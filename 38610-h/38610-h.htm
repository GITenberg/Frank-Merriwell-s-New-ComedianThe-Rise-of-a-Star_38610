<h2 class='chapter' id='clink01'>CHAPTER I.—“NEVER SAY DIE!”</h2>

<p>It is not a pleasant experience to wake up on a beautiful
morning to the realization that one has failed. There
seems a relentless irony in nature herself that the day
that dawns on a night when our glittering hopes have
become dead, dull ashes of despair and ruin should be
bright and warm with the sun’s genial rays.</p>

<p>So Frank Merriwell felt this fine morning in Puelbo,
Colorado. The night before, with high hopes, he had
produced his new play, “For Old Eli.” He recalled the
events of that first production with almost a shudder.
“For Old Eli” had been a failure, a flat, appalling, stupefying
failure. From the rise of the curtain everything
and everybody had gone wrong; lines were forgotten,
Ephraim Gallup had had stage fright, his own best situations
had been marred.</p>

<p>How much of this was due to the lying handbills
which had been scattered broadcast, asserting that he
was not the real Frank Merriwell, but an impostor, a
deadbeat and a thorough scoundrel, Frank could not tell.
He believed that these efforts to ruin him had little
effect, for when, at the close of the performance, he had
made a speech from the stage, assuring the audience that
he would bring his play back and give a satisfactory performance,
his reception had been cordial.</p>

<p>But the play had failed. Parker Folansbee, his backer,
had acted queerly, and Frank knew that, after the
company had reached Denver, the relations between him
and his backer would cease. “For Old Eli” had been
well-nigh ruinous, and when they got back to Denver,
Merry and his friends would be without funds.</p>

<p>Then the thought came to him of the prejudice expressed
against a poor black cat he had allowed to travel
with the company. He could not restrain a smile as he
perceived that the superstitious members of the company
would feel that the cat had hoodooed them. As if
a cat could affect the fortunes of men!</p>

<p>The thought of the cat gave a pleasant turn to his reflections,
and he cheered up immensely.</p>

<p>He had failed?</p>

<p>No!</p>

<p>He would not acknowledge failure, defeat, disaster.
He would not lie down and abandon the struggle, for
he was not built of such weak material.</p>

<p>Where was the fault? Was it in the piece, or in the
way it had been played?</p>

<p>He realized that, although the piece was well constructed,
it was not of a high, artistic character, such as
must appeal by pure literary merit to the best class of
theater patrons.</p>

<p>It could not be ranked with the best productions of
Pinero, Jones, Howard, Thomas, or even Clyde Fitch.
He had not written it with the hope of reaching such
a level. His aim had been to make a “popular” piece,
such as would appeal to the masses.</p>

<p>He fell to thinking over what had happened, and
trying to understand the cause of it all. He did not lay
the blame entirely on the actors.</p>

<p>It was not long before he decided that something
about his play had led the spectators to expect more
than they had received.</p>

<p>What was it they had expected?</p>

<p>While he was thinking of this alone in his room at
the hotel, Bart Hodge, his old friend and a member of
his company, came in. Hodge looked disgruntled, disappointed,
disgusted. He sat down on the bed without
speaking.</p>

<p>“Hello, old man,” said Frank, cheerfully. “What’s
the matter with your face? It would sour new milk.”</p>

<p>“And you ought to have a face that would sour
honey!” growled Bart. “I should if I were in your
place.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use? That wouldn’t improve things.”</p>

<p>“If I were in your place, I’d take a gun and go forth
and kill a few stiffs.”</p>

<p>“I always supposed a ‘stiff’ was dead. Didn’t know
one could be killed over again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can joke if you want to, but I don’t see how
you can feel like joking now. Anybody else would
swear.”</p>

<p>“And that would be foolish.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; but you know, as well as I do, that your
play was murdered and mangled last night.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, b’gosh!” drawled a doleful voice, and
Ephraim Gallup, another of the company, Frank’s boy
friend from Vermont, came stalking into the room, looking
quite as disgusted and dejected as Hodge. “An’ I’m
one of the murderers!”</p>

<p>Frank looked Ephraim over and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Why,” he cried, “your face is so long that you’ll be
hitting your toes against your chin when you walk, if
you’re not careful.”</p>

<p>“Whut I need is somebuddy to hit their toes against
my pants jest where I set down, an’ do it real hard,” said
Ephraim. “I wisht I’d stayed to hum on the farm when
I went back there and giv up the idee that I was an
actor. I kin dig ’taters an’ saw wood a darn sight better’n
I kin act!”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Ephraim,” assured Merry. “You
had to fill that part in a hurry, and you were not sure on
your lines. That worried you and broke you up. If
you had been sure of your lines, so that you would have
felt easy, I don’t think there would have been any
trouble as far as you were concerned.”</p>

<p>“I dunno abaout that. I never felt so gosh-darn scat
as I did larst night. Why, I jest shook all over, an’
one spell I didn’t think my laigs’d hold me up till I got
off ther stage. It was awful!”</p>

<p>“You had an attack of stage fright. They say all
great actors have it once in their lives.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I never want to feel that air way ag’in! An’ I
spoilt that scene in the dressin’ room of the clubhaouse.
Oh, jeewhillikins! I’m goin’ aout of the show business,
Frank, an’ git a job paoundin’ sand. It don’t take no
brains to do that.”</p>

<p>“Cheer up! You are going to play that same part in
this play, and you’ll play it well, too.”</p>

<p>“Whut? Then be yeou goin’ to keep right on with
the play?” asked the Vermonter, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“No,” said Merry, “I am not going to keep right on with
it. I am going to put it into shape to win, and then I’m
going out with it again. My motto is, ‘Never say die.’
You heard what I told the audience last night. I
promised them that I would play in this town and would
make a success. I shall keep that promise.”</p>

<p>Hodge shook his head.</p>

<p>“You are smart, Frank, but there’s a limit. I’m afraid
your luck has turned. You are hoodooed.”</p>

<p>Just then a coal-black cat came out from under the
bed and walked across the room.</p>

<p>“And I suppose you think this is my hoodoo?” smiled
Merry, as the cat came over and rubbed against his leg.
“That’s where you are away off. This cat is my mascot,
and she shall travel with me till the piece wins. She
has stuck to me close enough since she walked onto the
stage where we were rehearsing in Denver.”</p>

<p>“The cat is not the hoodoo,” said Bart, shaking his
head. “I know what is.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Name it.”</p>

<p>“I am!”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Frank stared at Bart in surprise, and then burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, how in the world did you happen to get such
a foolish notion into your head?” he cried.</p>

<p>“It’s not foolish,” declared Bart, stubbornly. “It’s
straight, I know it, and you can’t make me think differently.”</p>

<p>Frank rose and walked over to Hodge, putting a hand
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Now you are talking silly, old man,” he said. “You
never were bad luck to me in the past; why should you
be now. You’re blue. You are down in the mouth and
your head is filled with ridiculous fancies. Things would
have happened just as they have if you had not joined
the company.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“You always were superstitious, but I believe you are
worse than ever now. You have been playing poker too
much. That’s what ails you. The game makes every
man superstitious. He may not believe in luck at the
beginning, but he will after he has stuck to that game
a while. He will see all the odd things that happen with
cards, and the conviction that there is such a thing as
luck must grow upon him. He will become whimsical
and full of notions. That’s what’s the matter with you,
Hodge. Forget it, forget it!”</p>

<p>“I think you are likely to forget some things altogether
too early, Merriwell. For instance, some of your enemies.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use to remember unpleasant things?”</p>

<p>“They remember you. One of them did so to an extent
that he helped ruin the first presentation of your
play.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t possible that you have forgotten the lying
notices circulated all over this city, stating that you were
not the real Frank Merriwell, accusing you of being a
fake and a thief?”</p>

<p>Something like a shadow settled on Merry’s strong
face.</p>

<p>“No, I have not forgotten,” he declared, “I remember
all that, and I’d like to know just who worked the
game.”</p>

<p>“It was a gol-dinged measly trick!” exploded Ephraim.</p>

<p>“You thought it would not hurt you, Frank,” said
Hodge. “You fancied it would serve to advertise you,
if anything. It may have advertised you, but it did you
damage at the same time. When the audience saw everything
was going wrong, it grew angry and became convinced
that it was being defrauded. Then you had trouble
with that big ruffian who climbed over the footlights
with the avowed purpose of breaking up the show.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” smiled Merry, in a peculiar way, “that
fellow went right back over the footlights.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you threw him back. That quieted the audience
more than anything else, for it showed that you were
no slouch, even if you were a fake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose I’ll find out some time just who did
that little piece of advertising for me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; perhaps not.”</p>

<p>Tap, tap, tap—a knock on the door.</p>

<p>“Come!” Frank called.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Billy Wynne, the property
man, looked in.</p>

<p>“Letter for you, Mr. Merriwell,” he said.</p>

<p>Frank took the letter, and Wynne disappeared, after
being thanked for bringing it.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Merry, and he tore open the envelope.</p>

<p>A moment later, having glanced over the letter, he
whistled.</p>

<p>“News?” asked Bart.</p>

<p>“Just a note from the gentleman we were speaking
of just now,” answered Frank. “It’s from the party
who gave me the free advertising.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ll be kicked by a blind kaow!” exploded Gallup.
“An’ did he hev ther gall to write to ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank. “Listen to this.”</p>

<p>Then he read the letter aloud.</p>

<div class='bq'>
<p>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Mr. Frank Merriwell.</span></p>

<p>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Sir</span>: By this time you must be aware that you are
not the greatest thing that ever happened. You received it in
the neck last night, and I aided in the good work of knocking
you out, for I circulated the ‘warning’ notice which denounced
you as an impostor, a deadbeat and a thief. The public swallowed
it all, and, in disguise, I was at the theater to witness your
downfall. It was even greater than I had dared hope it would be.
I understand the managers in other towns have canceled with you,
Folansbee has declined to back your old show any longer, and you
are on the beach. Ha! ha! ha! This is revenge indeed. You are
knocked out at last, and I did it. You’ll never appear again as
the marvelous young actor-playwright, and the name of Frank
Merriwell will sink into oblivion. It is well. Yours with
satisfaction,</p>

<p style='text-align:right; margin:0 0ex 0 auto'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>LESLIE LAWRENCE</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I knew well enough it was that dirty rascal who did
the job!” cried Hodge, springing up. “The cur!”</p>

<p>“Waal, dinged if he hadn’t oughter be shot!” burst
from Gallup. “An’ he knows Folansbee’s gone back
on ye.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Frank,” said Hodge, disconsolately; “you
are done for. The story is out. Folansbee has skipped
us, and——”</p>

<p>“He has not skipped us. He’s simply decided to go
out of the theatrical business. It was a fad with him,
anyhow. As long as everything was going well, he liked
it; but I see he is a man who cannot stand hard luck.
He is changeable and that makes him a mighty poor man
to back a venture. It takes a man with determination
and a fixed purpose to win at anything. Changing
around, jumping from one thing to another, never having
any clear ideas is enough to make a failure of any man.
Folansbee doesn’t need to follow the show business for
a living. He went into it because it fascinated him.
The glamour is all worn off now, and he is ready to get
out if it. Let him go.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right to say let him go, but what are you
going to do without him? You are talking about putting
your play out again, but how will you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll find a way.”</p>

<p>“That is easier said than done. You have been lucky,
Frank, there is no question about that. You can’t be that
lucky all the time.”</p>

<p>“There are more ways than one to catch an angel.”</p>

<p>“I rather think you’ll find that angels are not so thick.
Once in a while there is a soft thing who is ready to
gamble with his money by putting it behind a traveling
theatrical company, but those soft things are growing
scarcer and scarcer. Too many of them have been
bitten.”</p>

<p>“Still, I have a feeling that I’ll find a way to succeed.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can advertise for a partner to invest
in a ‘sure thing,’ and all that, but those games are too
near fraud. Rascals have worked those schemes so
much that honest men avoid them.”</p>

<p>“I shall not resort to any trickery or deception. If I
catch an ‘angel’ I shall get one just as I obtained Folansbee,
by telling him all the risks and chances of failure.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll not get another that way.”</p>

<p>“Darned if I ain’t afraid now!” nodded Ephraim.
“But Mr. Folansbee’s goin’ to take keer of this comp’ny,
ain’t he? He’s goin’ to take it back to Denver?”</p>

<p>“He has agreed to do so.”</p>

<p>At this moment there was another sharp rap on the
door, which, happening to be near, Frank opened.</p>

<p>Cassie Lee walked in, followed by Roscoe Havener,
the soubrette and the stage manager of “For Old Eli,”
Cassie showed excitement.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of him?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Of whom—Havener?” asked Merry,</p>

<p>“No, Folansbee.”</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“He’s skipped.”</p>

<p>“Skipped?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Run away.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“It’s a straight fact,” declared the little soubrette.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt of it,” corroborated Havener.</p>

<p>“Waal, may I be tickled to death by grasshoppers!”
ejaculated Gallup.</p>

<p>“This caps the whole business!” burst from Hodge.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that,” said Merriwell, slowly. “How
do you know, Havener?”</p>

<p>“His baggage is gone. Garland and Dunton traced
him to the station. They were just in time to see him
board an eastbound train as it pulled out. He has deserted
us.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink02'>CHAPTER II.—DARKNESS AND DAWN.</h2>

<p>Frank could not express his astonishment.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe it,” he repeated. “Folansbee would
not do such a thing.”</p>

<p>Hodge laughed shortly, harshly.</p>

<p>“You have altogether too much confidence in human
nature, Merry,” he said. “I never took much stock in
this Folansbee. He is just the sort of person I would
expect to do such a trick.”</p>

<p>“The company is hot, Merriwell,” said Havener.
“They’re ready to eat you.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“For getting them into this scrape.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they can blame me.”</p>

<p>There came a sound of feet outside and a bang on the
door, which was flung open before Frank could reach it.
Into the room stalked Granville Garland, followed by the
remainder of the company. Plainly all were excited.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Merriwell,” said Garland, assuming an accusing
manner and striking a stage pose, “we are here.”</p>

<p>“So I see,” nodded Frank, calmly. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“You engaged us to fill parts in your play.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“We hold contracts with you.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. I think you are mistaken.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I made no contracts with you; I simply engaged you.
You hold contracts with Parker Folansbee.”</p>

<p>“Folansbee has deserted us, sir,” declared Garland,
accusingly. “We have been tricked, fooled, deceived!
We hold contracts. You were concerned with Folansbee
in putting this company on the road, and you are responsible.
We have come to you to find out what you
mean to do.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry——” began Frank.</p>

<p>“Being sorry for us doesn’t help us a bit,” cut in Garland,
rudely. “I believe you knew Folansbee was going
to skip.”</p>

<p>Frank turned his eyes full on the speaker, and he
seemed to look his accuser straight through and through.</p>

<p>“Mr. Garland,” he said, “you are rude and insulting.
I do not fancy the way you speak to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know,” put in Lloyd Fowler.
“I want my money. I didn’t come out here to be fooled
this way.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fowler,” spoke Frank, “you have not earned
any money. Instead, you have earned a fine by appearing
on the stage last night in a state of intoxication.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Then you li——”</p>

<p>Fowler did not quite finish the word. Frank had him
by the neck and pinned him against the wall in a moment.
Merry’s eyes were flashing fire, but his voice
was steady, as he said:</p>

<p>“Take it back, sir! Apologize instantly for that!”</p>

<p>Garland made a move as if he would interfere, but
Bart Hodge was before him in an instant, looking
straight into his face, and saying:</p>

<p>“Hands off! Touch him and you get thumped!”</p>

<p>“Get out!” cried Garland.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. If you want a scrap, I shall be
pleased to give you what you desire.”</p>

<p>“Here, fellows!” called Garland; “get in here all of
you and give these two tricksters a lesson! Come on!”</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Havener, stepping to the other side of
Merriwell. “Don’t try it, for I shall stand by him!”</p>

<p>“Me, too, boys!” cried Cassie Lee, getting into line
with her small fists clinched, and a look of determination
on her thin face. “Don’t nobody jump on Frank
Merriwell unless I take a hand in the racket.”</p>

<p>The rest of the company were astonished. They
realized that Frank had some friends, but it was not
until after he had awakened to realize just what the
situation meant that Ephraim Gallup drew himself together
and planted himself with Merry’s party.</p>

<p>“Whe-ee!” he squealed. “If there’s goin’ ter be a
ruction, yeou kin bet I’ll fight fer Merry, though I ain’t
much of a fighter. I’d ruther run then fight any day,
onless I have ter fight, but I reckon I’ll hev ter fight in
this case, if there is any fightin’.”</p>

<p>Immediately Granville Garland became very placid in
his manner.</p>

<p>“We didn’t come here to fight,” he said, “but we came
here to demand our rights.”</p>

<p>“An’ to sass Frank,” put in the Vermonter. “But,
b’gosh! yeou are barkin’ up ther wrong tree when yeou
tackle him! He kin jest natterally chaw yeou up.”</p>

<p>Frank still held Fowler against the wall. Now he
spoke to the fellow in a low, commanding tone:</p>

<p>“Apologize at once,” he said. “Come, sir, make
haste!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean anything,” faltered the frightened actor.
“I think I was too hasty. I apologize.”</p>

<p>“Be careful in the future,” advised Merry, releasing
him.</p>

<p>Then Merry turned to the others, saying:</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, until Havener just brought
the news, I did not know that Parker Folansbee was
gone. It was a great surprise for me, as I did not dream
he was a person to do such a thing. Even now I cannot
feel that he has entirely deserted us. He may have left
town rather than face us, but I hope he has been man
enough to leave money behind that will enable us to return
to Denver, at least. You must see that we are in the
same box together. I am hit as hard as any of you, for
I had hoped that Folansbee would stand by me so that I
would be able to put the play in better shape and take it
out again. I have lost him as a backer, and if he has
skipped without leaving us anything, I have barely
enough money to enable me to get back to Denver.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any way of getting hold of money?”
asked Harper.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I have not,” answered Merry. “If I
had money in my pocket I would spend the last cent to
square this thing with you.”</p>

<p>“And I know that’s on the level!” chirped Cassie Lee.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s mighty tough!” muttered Billy Wynne.
“That’s all I’ve got to say.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get up some kind of a benefit for ourselves,”
said Havener. “That’s the only thing left to do.”</p>

<p>“Come up to my room,” invited Miss Stanley, “and
we’ll try to devise a scheme for raising the dust.
Come on.”</p>

<p>They followed her out, leaving Ephraim, Bart and
Frank.</p>

<p>“Whew!” breathed Gallup, sitting down on the bed.
“Hanged if I didn’t kinder think there was goin’ to be a
ruction one spell. I wanted to run, but I warn’t goin’ to
leave Frank to be thrashed by a lot of hamfatters,
b’gee!”</p>

<p>“They were excited when they came in,” said Merry,
apologizing for the ones who had departed. “If it hadn’t
been for that, they would not have thought of making
such a scene.”</p>

<p>“Well, Frank,” spoke Bart, “I hope this will teach
you a lesson.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I hope it will teach you not to put so much confidence
in human nature after this. Have less confidence and do
more business in writing. I haven’t a doubt but Folansbee
would have stuck by you all right if the new play
had proved a winner, but he saw a chance to squeal
when it turned out bad, and he jumped you.”</p>

<p>“I had a contract with him about the other piece,” said
Merry; “but you know he did not return from St. Louis
till just before we were ready to start out, and so I
had not been able to arrange matters about this piece.”</p>

<p>“And that lets him out easy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he gets out without any trouble, and I don’t believe
I can do a thing about it.”</p>

<p>Again there came a rap on the door. When it was
opened, a bell boy, accompanied by a gray-bearded gentleman,
stood outside.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell,” said the bell boy, “here is a gentleman
to see you.”</p>

<p>The man entered.</p>

<p>“Walk right in, sir,” invited Merry. “What can I do
for you?”</p>

<p>Frank closed the door. The stranger slowly drew off
his gloves, critically looking Merriwell over.</p>

<p>“So you are Mr. Frank Merriwell?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I recognize you,” nodded the man. “Do you remember
me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I can’t say that I do, although I believe I
have seen your face before.”</p>

<p>“I think you have, but I did not wear a full beard
then.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Then it is possible the beard has made the
change that prevents me from recognizing you.”</p>

<p>“Quite likely.”</p>

<p>“Will you sit down?”</p>

<p>“I have some important business with you,” explained
the stranger, with a glance toward Gallup and Hodge.</p>

<p>Immediately Bart started for the door.</p>

<p>“See you later, Frank,” he said. “Come on, Ephraim.”</p>

<p>Gallup followed Hodge from the room.</p>

<p>When they were gone, Frank again invited the stranger
to be seated.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the man, as he accepted a chair.
“For reasons I wish you would look at me closely and
see if you recognize me. I recognize you, although you
are older, but I must proceed with the utmost caution in
this matter, and I wish you would recognize me and
state my name, so that I may feel absolutely certain that
I am making no mistake.”</p>

<p>Frank sat down opposite the gentleman, at whom he
gazed searchingly. He concentrated his mind in the
effort to remember. Frank had found that he could do
many difficult things by concentration of his mental
forces. Now he sought to picture in his mind the appearance
of this man without a beard. Gradually, he
felt that he was drawing nearer and nearer the object
he sought. Finally he made a request:</p>

<p>“Please speak again, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why do you wish me to, speak again?” said the
stranger, smiling.</p>

<p>“So that your voice may aid me in remembering. I
wish to associate your voice and your face.”</p>

<p>“Very well. What do you wish me to say?”</p>

<p>“You have said enough. I have your voice now.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’ll not be able to remember,” said the
stranger. “It doesn’t make any great difference, for I
recognize you, and I can make assurance doubly sure by
asking you a few questions. First, I wish to ask——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” interrupted Merry. “You are from
Carson City, Nevada. You are connected with the bank
in Carson, where I deposited a certain amount of valuable
treasure, found by myself and some friends years
ago in the Utah Desert. Your name is Horace Hobson.”</p>

<p>“Correct!” cried the man, with satisfaction. “Now,
can you produce the receipt given you for that treasure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” nodded Frank, immediately producing a
leather pocketbook and opening it. “I have it here.”</p>

<p>In a moment he had found the paper and handed it
to Mr. Hobson.</p>

<p>The gentleman adjusted some gold-rimmed nose-glasses
and looked the receipt over.</p>

<p>“This is the receipt,” he nodded. “You instructed the
bank officials to use every effort and spare no expense to
find the relatives of Prof. Millard Fillmore and the rightful
heirs to the treasure.”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“I am here to inform you that the bank has carried
out your instructions faithfully.”</p>

<p>“Then you have found Prof. Fillmore’s relatives?”
quickly asked Merry, his heart sinking a bit.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, we have found that he has no
relatives living. He seems to have been the last of his
family—the end of it——”</p>

<p>“Then——”</p>

<p>“It has been necessary for us to go to considerable expense
to settle this point beyond a doubt, but we have
done so, in accordance with your directions. Of course,
we shall not lose anything. We have ascertained the
exact value of the treasure, and have deducted for our
expense and trouble. At a meeting of the bank directors
I was instructed to turn over the remainder to
you. I have here papers showing the exact valuation of
the treasure as deposited with us. Here is a complete
account of all our expenses and charges. We have found
a balance remaining of forty-three thousand seven hundred
and thirty-eight dollars. I was sent to turn this
money over to you, as I could identify you beyond doubt,
and there could be no mistake. To make it certain in my
own mind, I wished you to recognize me. You did so,
and I knew I could not be making a mistake. I will take
up this receipt here, and in return will give you a check
for the amount, if that is satisfactory to you.”</p>

<p>Frank sat like one dazed, staring at Horace Hobson.
Was it possible that he was not dreaming? Was he in
his hour of need to receive this immense sum of money?
No wonder he fancied he was dreaming.</p>

<p>At last he gave himself a slight shake, and his voice
did not falter as he said:</p>

<p>“It is perfectly satisfactory to me, sir. I will accept
the check.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink03'>CHAPTER III.—MERRIWELL’S GENEROSITY.</h2>

<p>Mr. Hobson departed, and then Frank rang for a bell
boy and sent for Bart and Ephraim. Merry’s two friends
came in a short time.</p>

<p>“I have called you up,” said Merry, “to talk over the
arrangements for putting ‘For Old Eli’ on the road
again without delay. I have decided on that. It will
take some little time to manufacture the costly mechanical
effect that I propose to introduce into the third act, and
we shall have to get some new paper. I believe I can
telegraph a description to Chicago so a full stand lithograph
from stone can be made that will suit me, and I
shall telegraph to-day.”</p>

<p>Hodge stared at Frank as if he thought Merry had
lost his senses.</p>

<p>“You always were a practical joker,” he growled; “but
don’t you think it’s about time to let up? I don’t see that
this is a joking matter. You should have some sympathy
for our feelings, if you don’t care for yourself.”</p>

<p>Merry laughed a bit.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” he said, “I assure you I was never
more serious. I am not joking. I shall telegraph for
the paper immediately.”</p>

<p>“Paper like that costs money, and the lithographers
will demand a guarantee before they touch the work.”</p>

<p>“And I shall give them a guarantee. I shall instruct
them to draw on the First National Bank of Denver,
where my money will be deposited.”</p>

<p>“Your money?” gasped Hodge.</p>

<p>“Jeewhillikins!” gurgled Gallup.</p>

<p>Then Frank’s friends looked at each other, the same
thought in the minds of both.</p>

<p>Had Merry gone mad? Had his misfortune turned his
brain?</p>

<p>“I believe I can have the effect I desire to introduce
manufactured for me in Denver,” Frank went on. “I shall
brace up that third act with it. I shall make a spectacular
climax on the order of the mechanical horse races you
see on the stage. I shall have some dummy figures and
boats made, so that the boat race may be seen on the
river in the distance. I have an idea of a mechanical
arrangement to represent the crowd that lines the river
and the observation train that carries a load of spectators
along the railroad that runs beside the river. I
think the swaying crowd can be shown, the moving train,
the three boats, Yale, Harvard and Cornell, with their
rowers working for life. Harvard shall be a bit in the
lead when the boats first appear, but Yale shall press her
and take the lead. Then I will have the scene shifted instantly,
so that the audience will be looking into the Yale
clubhouse. The rear of the house shall open direct upon
the river. There shall be great excitement in the clubhouse,
which I will have located at the finish of the
course. The boats are coming. Outside, along the river,
mad crowds are cheering hoarsely, whistles are screeching,
Yale students are howling the college cry. Here
they come! Now the excitement is intense. Hurrah!
Yale has taken the lead! The boats shoot in view at the
back of the stage, Yale a length ahead, Harvard next,
Cornell almost at her side, and in this form they cross
the line, Yale the victor. The star of the piece, myself,
who has escaped from his enemies barely in time to enter
the boat and help win the race, is brought on by the
madly cheering college men, and down comes the curtain
on a climax that must set any audience wild.”</p>

<p>Hodge sat down on the bed.</p>

<p>“Frank,” he said, grimly, “you’re going crazy! It
would cost a thousand dollars to get up that effect.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it costs two thousand dollars, I’ll have
it, and I’ll have it in a hurry!” laughed Merriwell. “I am
out for business now. I am in the ring to win this time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are going crazy!” nodded Hodge. “Where
is all the money coming from?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!”</p>

<p>Bart went into the air as if he had received an electric
shock.</p>

<p>“You—you’ve what?” he yelled.</p>

<p>“Got the money,” asserted Frank.</p>

<p>“Where?” shouted Bart.</p>

<p>“Right here.”</p>

<p>“May I be tickled to death by muskeeters!” gasped
Gallup.</p>

<p>“Got two thousand dollars?” said Hodge. “Oh, come
off, Merriwell! You are carrying this thing too far
now!”</p>

<p>“Just take a look at this piece of paper,” invited Frank,
as he passed over the check he had received from Horace
Hobson.</p>

<p>Bart took it, he looked at it, he was stricken dumb.</p>

<p>Gallup looked over Bart’s shoulder. His jaw dropped,
his eyes bulged from his head, and he could not utter a
sound.</p>

<p>“How do you like the looks of it?” smiled Merry.</p>

<p>“What—what is it?” faltered Bart.</p>

<p>“A check. Can’t you see? A check that is good for
forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight dollars.”</p>

<p>“Good for that? Why, it can’t be! Now, is this more
of your joking, Merriwell? If it is, I swear I shall feel
like having a fight with you right here!”</p>

<p>“It’s no joke, old man. That piece of paper is good—it
is good for every dollar. The money is payable to me.
I’ve got the dust to put my play out in great style.”</p>

<p>Even then Bart could not believe it. He groped for
the bed and sat down, limply, still staring at the check,
which he held in his hand.</p>

<p>“What’s this for?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s for the Fillmore treasure, which I found in the
Utah Desert,” exclaimed Frank. “It was brought to me
by the man who came in here a little while ago.”</p>

<p>Then Gallup collapsed.</p>

<p>His knees seemed to buckle beneath him, and he
dropped down on the bed.</p>

<p>“Waal, may I be chawed up fer grass by a spavin
hoss!” he murmured.</p>

<p>Hodge sat quite still for some seconds.</p>

<p>“Merry,” he said, at last, beginning to tremble all
over, “are you sure this is good? Are you sure there is
no crooked business behind it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“How can you be?” asked Bart.</p>

<p>“I received it from the very man with whom I did the
business in Carson when I made the deposit. In order
that there might be no mistake he came on here and delivered
it to me personally.”</p>

<p>“I think I’m dyin’!” muttered Ephraim. “I’ve received
a shock from which I’ll never rekiver! Forty-three
thousan’ dollars! Oh, say, I know there’s a mistake
here!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of a mistake,” assured Merriwell, smiling,
triumphant.</p>

<p>“And all that money is yourn?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, ther check’s made out to yeou.”</p>

<p>“Because the treasure was deposited by me.”</p>

<p>“And yeou faound it?”</p>

<p>“I found it, but I did so while in company with four
friends.”</p>

<p>Now Hodge showed still further excitement.</p>

<p>“Those friends were not with you at the moment when
you found it,” he said. “I’ve heard your story. You
came near losing your life. The mad hermit fought to
throw you from the precipice. The way you found the
treasure, the dangers you passed through, everything that
happened established your rightful claim to it. It belongs
to you alone.”</p>

<p>“I do not look at it in that light,” said Frank, calmly
and positively. “There were five of us in the party.
The others were my friends Diamond, Rattleton, Browning,
and Toots.”</p>

<p>“A nigger!” exclaimed Bart. “Do you call him your
friend?”</p>

<p>“I do!” exclaimed Merry. “More than once that black
boy did things for me which I have never been able to
repay. Although a coward at heart so far as danger to
himself was concerned, I have known him to risk his life
to save me from harm. Why shouldn’t I call him my
friend? His skin may be black, but his heart is white.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” muttered Hodge. “I haven’t anything
more to say. I was not one of your party at that
time.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been.”</p>

<p>“So yeou could git yeour share of the boodle?”
grinned Ephraim.</p>

<p>“No!” cried Hodge, fiercely. “So I could show the
rest of them how to act like men! I would refuse to
touch one cent of it! I would tell Frank Merriwell that
it belonged to him, and he could not force me to take it.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe the others’ll do that air way,” suggested the
Vermont youth.</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” sneered Bart. “They’ll gobble
onto their shares with both hands. I know them, I’ve
traveled with them, and I am not stuck on any of them.”</p>

<p>“I shall compel them to take it,” smiled Frank. “I
am sorry, fellows, that you both were not with me, so I
could bring you into the division. I’d find a way to
compel Hodge to accept his share.”</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years!” exploded Bart.</p>

<p>“Waal,” drawled Ephraim, “I ain’t saying, but I’d like
a sheer of that money well enough, but there’s one thing
I am sayin’. Sence Hodge has explained why he
wouldn’t tech none of it, I be gol-dinged if yeou could
force a single cent onter me ef I hed bin with yeou, same
as them other fellers was! I say Hodge is jest right
abaout that business. The money belongs to yeou,
Frank, an’ yeou’re the only one that owns a single dollar
of it, b’gosh!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Ephraim,” nodded Hodge. “And there
isn’t another chap in the country who would insist on
giving away some of his money to others under similar
circumstances. Some people might call it generosity; I
call it thundering foolishness!”</p>

<p>“I can’t help what you call it,” said Frank; “I shall
do what I believe is right and just, and thus I will have
nothing to trouble my conscience.”</p>

<p>“Conscience! conscience! You’ll never be rich in the
world, for you have too much conscience. Do you
suppose the Wall Street magnates could have become millionaires
if they had permitted their conscience to worry
them over little points?”</p>

<p>“I fancy not,” acknowledged Merry, shaking his head.
“I am certain I shall never become wealthy in just the
same manner that certain millionaires acquired their
wealth. I’d rather remain poor. Such an argument does
not touch me, Hodge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose not! But it’s a shame for you to be
such a chump! Just think what you could do with
forty-three thousand dollars! You could give up this
show business, you could go back to Yale and finish your
course in style. You could be the king-bee of them all.
Oh, it’s a shame!”</p>

<p>“Haow much’ll yeou hev arter yeou divide?” asked
Ephraim.</p>

<p>“The division will give the five of us eight thousand
seven hundred and forty-six dollars and eighty cents
each,” answered Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s figured that up so quick!” muttered Hodge.</p>

<p>“I snum! eight thaousan’ dollars ain’t to be sneezed
at!” cried the Vermonter.</p>

<p>“It’s a pinch beside forty-three thousand,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“Yeou oughter be able to go back to college on that,
Frank.”</p>

<p>“He can, if he’ll drop the show business,” nodded
Bart.</p>

<p>“And confess myself a failure! Acknowledge that I
failed in this undertaking? Would you have me do
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wouldn’t confess anything of the sort. What
were you working for? To go back to Yale, was it not?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t suppose you expected to make so much
money that you would be able to return with more than
eight thousand dollars in your inside pocket?”</p>

<p>“Hardly.”</p>

<p>“Then what is crawling over you? If you are fool
enough to make this silly division, you can go back with
money enough to take you through your course in style.”</p>

<p>“And have the memory of what happened in this
town last night rankle in my heart! Hardly! I made
a speech from the stage last night, in which I said I
would play again in this city, and I promised that the
audience should be satisfied. I shall keep that promise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right! I suppose you’ll be thinking of rewarding
the ladies and gentlemen who called here a
short time ago and attempted to bulldoze you?”</p>

<p>“I shall see that the members of the company, one and
all, are treated fairly. I shall pay them two weeks salary,
which will be all they can ask.”</p>

<p>Hodge got up, thrust his hands deep into his pockets,
and stared at Frank, with an expression on his face that
was little short of disgust.</p>

<p>“You beat them all!” he growled. “I’d do just like
that—I don’t think! Not one of those people has a
claim on you. I’d let them all go to the deuce! It would
be serving them right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall do nothing of the sort, my dear fellow.”</p>

<p>“I presume you will pay Lloyd Fowler two weeks
salary?”</p>

<p>“I shall.”</p>

<p>Bart turned toward the door.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’m going out somewhere all alone by myself, where
I can say some things about you. I am going to express
my opinion of you to myself. I don’t want to do it here,
for there would be a holy fight. I’ve got to do it in order
to let off steam and cool down. I shall explode if I
keep it corked up inside of me.”</p>

<p>He bolted out of the room, slamming the door fiercely
behind him.</p>

<p>Frank and Ephraim went up to the room of Stella
Stanley, which was on the next floor. They found all
the members of the company packed into that room.</p>

<p>“May we come in?” asked Merry, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“We don’t need him,” muttered Lloyd Fowler, who
was seated in a corner. “Don’t get him into the benefit
performance. Let him take care of himself.”</p>

<p>“Come right in, Mr. Merriwell,” invited Stella Stanley.
“I believe you can sing. We’re arranging a program
for the benefit, you know. Shall we put you down
for a song?”</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“Ah!” muttered Fowler, triumphantly. “He thinks
himself too fine to take part in such a performance with
the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“I rather think you’ve hit it,” whispered Charlie
Harper.</p>

<p>“And I know you are off your trolley!” hissed Cassie
Lee, who had not missed the words of either of them.
“He’s on the level.”</p>

<p>“Really!” exclaimed Miss Stanley, in surprise and disappointment.
“Do you actually refuse?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there will be no performance.”</p>

<p>“Won’t?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to permit it,” said Frank, a queer twinkle
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Then several of the company came up standing, and
shouted:</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“That beats anything I ever heard of in my life!”
said Fowler.</p>

<p>“For genuine crust, it surely does!” spoke up Harper.</p>

<p>Cassie Lee looked surprised, and Havener was amazed.</p>

<p>“Surely you are not in earnest, Merriwell?” the stage
manager hastened to say.</p>

<p>“Never more so in my life!” answered Frank, easily.</p>

<p>“Then you’re crazy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are,” said Garland. “You have gone over
the limit. We are not engaged to you in any way. You
said so. You explained that we could not hold you responsible.
You cannot come here and dictate to us. We
shall carry out this performance. If you try to prevent
it, you will make a great mistake.”</p>

<p>“Be calm,” advised Merry. “You are unduly exciting
yourself, Mr. Garland.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s enough to excite anyone!”</p>

<p>“Meow!”</p>

<p>Out of the room trotted Frank’s black cat, which had
followed him up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Put that cat out!” cried Agnes Kirk. “It has caused
all our bad luck!”</p>

<p>Frank picked the cat up.</p>

<p>“I told you the cat was a mascot,” he said. “It has
proved so!”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” sneered Fowler.</p>

<p>“Let him take himself out of here, cat and all!” cried
Charlie Harper.</p>

<p>“Let him explain what he means by saying we shall
not give a benefit performance,” urged Havener, who
really hoped that Frank could say something to put himself
in a better light with the company.</p>

<p>“Yes,” urged Cassie. “What did you mean by that,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Such a performance is quite unnecessary,” assured
Merry.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do something to raise money to get out
of this city.”</p>

<p>“I will furnish you with the money, each and every
one.”</p>

<p>“You?” shouted several.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked Havener. “You said a short time ago
that you hadn’t enough money to amount to anything.”</p>

<p>“At that time I hadn’t. Since then I have been able to
make a raise.”</p>

<p>Now there was another bustle of excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried several, “that’s different.”</p>

<p>“I knew there was something behind it!” exclaimed
Cassie, with satisfaction. “Have you been able to raise
enough to take us all back to Denver, Frank?”</p>

<p>“I think so, and I believe I shall have a few dollars left
after we arrive there.”</p>

<p>“How much have you raised?” asked Havener.</p>

<p>“Forty-three thousand dollars,” answered Frank, as
coolly as if he were saying forty-three dollars.</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence in the room, then expressions
of incredulity and scorn came from all sides.</p>

<p>Fowler set up a shout of mocking laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the big bluffs I ever heard this is the
biggest!” he sneered.</p>

<p>“Say, I don’t mind a joke,” said Stella Stanley; “but
don’t you think you are carrying this thing a trifle too
far, Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“I would be if it were a joke,” confessed Frank, easily;
“but, as it happens to be the sober truth, I think no
one has a chance to ask. I will not only pay your fare
to Denver, but each one shall receive two weeks salary,
which I think you must acknowledge is the proper way
to treat you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll believe it when I get my hands on the dough,”
said Fowler. “Forty-three thousand fiddlesticks!”</p>

<p>“Any person who doubts my word is at liberty to take
a look at this certified check,” said Merry, producing
the check and placing it on the little table.</p>

<p>Then they crushed and crowded about that table, staring
at the check.</p>

<p>Fowler nudged Harper, to whom he whispered:</p>

<p>“I believe it’s straight, so help me! I’d like to kick
myself!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s straight,” acknowledged Harper, dolefully.
“I am just beginning to realize that we have made fools
of ourselves by talking too much.”</p>

<p>“What can we do?”</p>

<p>“Take poison!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to eat dirt, or he’ll throw us down.”</p>

<p>“It looks that way.”</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Fowler was almost the first
to offer congratulations.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Mr. Merriwell,” he cried, “I’m delighted!
You are dead in luck, and you deserve it! It was pretty
hard for you to be deserted by Folansbee, in such a
sneaking way. I have said all along that you were a
remarkably bright man and merited success.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” put in Harper; “he said so to me last
night. We were talking over your hard luck. I congratulate
you, Mr. Merriwell. Permit me!”</p>

<p>“Permit me!”</p>

<p>Both Harper and Fowler held out their hands.</p>

<p>Frank looked at the extended hands, but put his own
hands in his pockets, laughing softly, somewhat scornfully.</p>

<p>“It is wonderful,” he said, “how many true friends
a man can have when he has money, and how few true
friends he really has when he doesn’t have a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Mr. Merriwell!” protested Fowler. “I
know I was rather hasty in some of my remarks, but I
assure you that you misunderstood me. It was natural
that all of us should be a trifle hot under the collar at being
used as we were. I assure you I did not mean anything
by what I said. If I spoke too hastily, I beg a
thousand pardons. Again let me congratulate you.”</p>

<p>Again he held out his hand.</p>

<p>“You are at liberty to congratulate me,” said Merry,
but still disdaining the proffered hand. “I shall pay you
the same as the others. Don’t be afraid of that. But I
shall give you your notice, for I shall not need you any
more. With several of the others I shall make contracts
to go out with this piece again, as soon as I can make
some alterations, get new paper, and start the company.”</p>

<p>Fowler turned green.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course you can do as you like, sir,” he said.
“I don’t think I care to go out with this piece again.
It is probable I should so inform you, even if you wanted
me.”</p>

<p>Harper backed away. He did not wish to receive such
a calling down as had fallen to the lot of Fowler.</p>

<p>Cassie Lee held out her hand, her thin face showing
actual pleasure.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how glad I am, Frank!” she said,
in a low tone. “Never anybody deserved it more than
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Havener.</p>

<p>Douglas Dunton had not been saying much, but now
he stood forth, struck a pose, and observed:</p>

<p>“Methinks that, along with several of me noble colleagues,
I have made a big mistake in making offensive
remarks to you, most noble high muck-a-muck. Wouldst
do me a favor? Then apply the toe of thy boot to the
seat of me lower garments with great vigor.”</p>

<p>Frank laughed.</p>

<p>“The same old Dunton!” he said. “Forget it, old
man. It’s all right. There’s no harm done.”</p>

<p>While the members of the company were crowding
around Merriwell, Fowler and Harper slipped out of
the room and descended the stairs.</p>

<p>Straight to the bar of the hotel they made their way.
Leaning against the bar, they took their drinks, and
discussed Frank’s fortune.</p>

<p>Another man was drinking near them. He pricked
up his ears and listened when he heard Merriwell’s name,
and he grew excited as he began to understand what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, gentlemen,” he said, after a time. “I do
not wish to intrude, but I happen to know Mr. Merriwell.
Will you have a drink with me?”</p>

<p>They accepted. They were just the sort of chaps who
drink with anybody who would “set ’em up.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind telling me just what has happened to
Mr. Merriwell?” asked the stranger, who wore a full
beard, which seemed to hide many of the features of his
face. “Has he fallen heir to a fortune?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” answered Harper, dryly. “More than forty-three
thousand dollars has dropped into his hands this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” asked the stranger, showing agitation.
“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure. I saw the certified check on a Carson
City bank. He was broke this morning, but now
he has money to burn.”</p>

<p>The stranger lifted a glass to his lips. His hand
trembled somewhat. All at once, with a savage oath, he
dashed the glass down on the bar, shivering it to atoms.
As he did so, the hairs of his beard caught around the
stone of a ring on his little finger, and the beard was
torn from his face, showing it was false.</p>

<p>The face revealed was black with discomfiture and
rage.</p>

<p>It was the face of Leslie Lawrence!</p>

<p>Frank’s old enemy was again discomfited!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink04'>CHAPTER IV.—IN THE SMOKER.</h2>

<p>So Frank took the company back to Denver. He
was able to do so without depositing the check till Denver
was reached, as Horace Hobson furnished the funds,
holding the check as security.</p>

<p>Hobson went along at the same time.</p>

<p>While on the train Frank made arrangements with
several members of his company in the revised version of
“For Old Eli,” when the play went on the road again.</p>

<p>He said nothing to Lloyd Fowler nor Charlie Harper.
Although he did not make arrangements with Granville
Garland, he asked Garland if he cared to go out with
the company again, informing him that he might have an
opening for him.</p>

<p>Fowler saw Merry talking with some of the members,
and he surmised what it meant. He began to feel anxious
as time passed, and Frank did not come to him.
He went to Harper to talk it over.</p>

<p>Harper was in the smoker, pulling at a brierwood
pipe and looking sour enough. He did not respond when
Fowler spoke to him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Fowler. “Sick?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” growled Harper.</p>

<p>“What ails you?”</p>

<p>“Disgusted.”</p>

<p>“At what?”</p>

<p>“Somebody.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Myself for one.”</p>

<p>“Somebody else?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“You’re it.”</p>

<p>Fowler fell back and stared at Harper. He had taken
a seat opposite his fellow actor. Harper returned his
stare with something like still greater sourness.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with me?” asked Fowler, wondering.</p>

<p>“You’re a confounded idiot!” answered Harper,
bluntly.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say I like your plain language!” exclaimed
Fowler, coloring and looking decidedly touched.
“You were in a bad temper when we started for Denver,
but you seem to be worse now. What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see now that I’ve put a foot in the soup. I
am broke, and I need money. All I am liable to get is
the two weeks salary I shall receive from Merriwell.
If I’d kept my mouth shut I might have a new engagement
with him, like the others.”</p>

<p>“Then some of the others have a new engagement?”</p>

<p>“All of them, I reckon, except you and I. We are the
fools of the company.”</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Can’t do anything but keep still and swallow our
medicine.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you think that, but I’m going to hit Merriwell
up.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll be a bigger fool if you do, after the calling
down you received from him to-day.”</p>

<p>At that moment Frank entered the smoker, looking
for Hodge, who had been unable to procure a good seat
in one of the other cars. Bart was sitting near Harper
and Fowler.</p>

<p>As Frank came down the aisle, Fowler arose.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you, Mr. Merriwell,” he said.</p>

<p>“All right,” nodded Frank. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that you are making new engagements
with the members of the company.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You haven’t said anything to me.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is because I made some foolish talk to
you this morning. Well, I apologized, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I presume you will give me a chance when you
take the play out again?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Frank said it quietly, looking Fowler full in the face.</p>

<p>“So you are going to turn me down because I made
that talk? Well, I have heard considerable about your
generosity, but this does not seem very generous.”</p>

<p>“Ever since joining the company and starting to rehearse,
Mr. Fowler, you have been a source of discord.
Once or twice you came near flatly refusing to do some
piece of business the way I suggested. Once you insolently
informed me that I was not the stage manager.
You completely forgot that I was the author of the piece.
I have heard that you told others not to do things as I
suggested, but to do them in their own way. Several
times before we started out I was on the verge of releasing
you, which I should have done had there been time
to fill your place properly. Last night you were intoxicated
when the hour arrived for the curtain to go up.
You went onto the stage in an intoxicated condition.
You did not do certain pieces of business as you had been
instructed to do them, but as you thought they should
be done, therefore ruining a number of scenes. You
were insolent, and would have been fined a good round
sum for it had we gone on. In a number of ways you
have shown that you are a man I do not want in my company,
so I shall let you go, after paying you two weeks
salary. I believe I have given the best of reasons for
pursuing such a course.”</p>

<p>Then Frank stepped past Fowler and sat down with
Hodge.</p>

<p>The actor took his seat beside Harper, who said:</p>

<p>“I hope you are satisfied now!”</p>

<p>“Satisfied!” muttered Fowler. “I’d like to punch his
head off!”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” nodded Harper; “but you can’t do it,
you know. He is a holy terror, and you are not in his
class.”</p>

<p>Behind them was a man who seemed to be reading
a newspaper. He was holding the paper very high,
so that his face could not be seen, and he was not reading
at all. He was listening with the keenest interest to
everything.</p>

<p>As Frank sat down beside Hodge he observed a look
of great satisfaction on Bart’s face.</p>

<p>“Well, Merriwell,” said the dark-faced youth, with
something like the shadow of a smile, “you have done
yourself proud.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go forward,” suggested Merry. “The smoke
is pretty thick here, and some of it from those pipes is
rank. I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>So they got up and left the car.</p>

<p>As they went out, Fowler glared at Merriwell’s back,
hissing:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d like to get even with you!”</p>

<p>Instantly the man behind lowered his paper, leaned
forward, and said:</p>

<p>“I see you do not like Mr. Merriwell much. If you
want to get even with him, I may be able to show you
how to do it.”</p>

<p>With startled exclamations, both Harper and Fowler
turned round. The man behind was looking at them
over the edge of his paper.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Fowler.</p>

<p>“I think you know me,” said the man, lowering his
paper.</p>

<p>Lawrence sat there!</p>

<p>In Denver Frank was accompanied to the bank by Mr.
Hobson. It happened that Kent Carson, a well-known
rancher whom Frank had met, was making a deposit at
the bank.</p>

<p>“Hello, young man!” cried the rancher, in surprise.
“I thought you were on the road with your show?”</p>

<p>“I was,” smiled Frank, “but met disaster at the very
start, and did not get further than Puelbo.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s tough!” said Carson, sympathetically.
“What was the matter?”</p>

<p>“A number of things,” confessed Frank. “The play
was not strong enough without sensational features. I
have found it necessary to introduce a mechanical effect,
besides rewriting a part of the play. I shall start out
again with it as soon as I can get it into shape.”</p>

<p>“Then your backer is all right? He’s standing by
you?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” smiled Merry, “he skipped out
from Puelbo yesterday morning, leaving me and the
company in the lurch.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was ornery!” said Carson. “What are
you going to do without a backer?”</p>

<p>“Back myself. I have the money now to do so. I
am here to make a deposit.”</p>

<p>Then it came about that he told Mr. Carson of his
good fortune, and the rancher congratulated him most
heartily.</p>

<p>Frank presented his check for deposit, asking for a
check book. The eyes of the receiving teller bulged
when he saw the amount of the check. He looked
Frank over critically.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobson had introduced Frank, and the teller
asked him if he could vouch for the identity of the young
man.</p>

<p>“I can,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“So can I,” spoke up Kent Carson. “I reckon my
word is good here. I’ll stand behind this young man.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to put your name on the back of this
check, Mr. Carson?” asked the teller.</p>

<p>“Hand it over,” directed the rancher.</p>

<p>He took the check and endorsed it with his name.</p>

<p>“There,” he said, “I reckon you know it’s good now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the teller. “There will be no delay now.
Mr. Merriwell can draw on us at once.”</p>

<p>Frank thanked Mr. Carson heartily.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the cattleman, in an offhand
way. “I allow that a chap who will defend a ragged
boy as you did is pretty apt to be all right. How
long will it take to get your play in shape again?”</p>

<p>“Well, I may be three or four days rewriting it. I
don’t know how long the other work will be.”</p>

<p>“Three or four days. Well, say, why can’t you come
out to my ranch and do the work?”</p>

<p>“Really, I don’t see how I can do that,” declared
Frank. “I must be here to see that the mechanical arrangement
is put up right.”</p>

<p>“Now you must come,” declared Carson. “I won’t
take no for your answer. You can give instructions for
that business. I suppose you have a plan of it?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, but I shall have before night.”</p>

<p>“Can you get your business here done to-day?”</p>

<p>“I may be able to, but I am not sure.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re going with me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave my friends who are——”</p>

<p>“Bring them right along. It doesn’t make a bit of
difference if there are twenty of them. I’ll find places
for them, and they shall have the best the Twin Star
affords. Now, if you refuse that offer, you and I are
enemies.”</p>

<p>The man said this laughingly, but he placed Frank
in an awkward position. He had just done a great
favor for Merriwell, and Frank felt that he could not
refuse.</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Carson,” he said, “if you put it in
that light, I’ll have to accept your hospitality.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk! Won’t my boy at Yale be surprised
when I write him you’ve been visiting me? Ha! ha!
ha!”</p>

<p>Mr. Carson was stopping at the Metropole, while
Frank had chosen the American. The rancher urged
Merry to move right over to the Metropole, and the
young actor-playwright finally consented.</p>

<p>But Frank had business for that day. First he telegraphed
to the lithographers in Chicago a long description
of the scene which he wanted made on his new
paper. He ordered it rushed, and directed them to
draw on his bankers for any reasonable sum.</p>

<p>Then he started out to find the proper men to construct
the mechanical effect he wished. He went straight
to the theater first, and he found that the stage manager
of the Broadway was a genius who could make
anything. Frank talked with the man twenty minutes,
and decided that he had struck the person for
whom he was looking.</p>

<p>It did not take them long to come to terms. The
man had several assistants who could aid him on the
work, and he promised to rush things. Frank felt well
satisfied.</p>

<p>Returning to his hotel, Merry drew a plan of what
he desired. As he was skillful at drawing, and very
rapid, it did not take him more than two hours to draw
the plan and write out an explicit explanation of it.</p>

<p>With that he returned to the stage manager. They
spent another hour talking it over, and Frank left,
feeling satisfied that the man perfectly understood his
wants and would produce an arrangement as satisfactory
as it could be if it were overseen during its construction
by Frank himself.</p>

<p>Frank was well satisfied with what he had accomplished.
He went back to the American and drew up
checks for every member of the old company, paying
them all two weeks salary. Lloyd Fowler took the
check without a word of thanks. The others expressed
their gratitude.</p>

<p>Then Frank moved over to the Metropole, where he
found Kent Carson waiting for him.</p>

<p>Hodge and Gallup came along with Frank.</p>

<p>“These are the friends I spoke of, Mr. Carson,” explained
Frank.</p>

<p>“Where’s the rest of them?” asked the rancher, looking
about.</p>

<p>“These are all.”</p>

<p>“All?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why, by the way you talked, I reckoned you were
going to bring your whole company along.”</p>

<p>He remembered Hodge, whom he had seen with
Frank once before, and he shook hands with both Bart
and Ephraim.</p>

<p>“You are lucky to be counted as friends of a young
man like Mr. Merriwell,” said the cattleman. “That is,
you’re lucky if he’s anything like what my boy wrote that
he was. My boy is a great admirer of him.”</p>

<p>“It’s strange I don’t remember your son,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s a freshman.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I know a large number of freshmen.”</p>

<p>“So my boy said. Said you knew them because some
of them had been trying to do you a bad turn; but he
was glad to see you get the best of them, for you were
all right. He said the freshmen as a class thought so,
too.”</p>

<p>“Your son was very complimentary. If I return to
Yale, I shall look him up.”</p>

<p>“Then you contemplate returning to college?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Next fall, if I do not lose my money backing my
play.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t lose forty-three thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“That is not all mine to lose. Only one-fifth of that
belongs to me, and I can lose that sum.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you let the show business alone and
go back to college on that?”</p>

<p>“Because I have determined to make a success with
this play, and I will not give up. Never yet in my life
have I been defeated in an undertaking, and I will not be
defeated now.”</p>

<p>The rancher looked at Frank with still greater admiration.</p>

<p>“You make me think of some verses I read once,”
he said. “I’ve always remembered them, and I think
they’ve had something to do with my success in life.
They were written by Holmes.”</p>

<p>The rancher paused, endeavoring to recall the lines.
It was plain to Frank that he was not a highly educated
man, but he was highly intelligent—a man who had
won his way in the world by his own efforts and determination.
For that reason, he admired determination
in others.</p>

<p>“I have it!” exclaimed the rancher. “Here it is:</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  “‘Be firm! One constant element in luck<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Is genuine, solid, old Teutonic pluck.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  See yon tall shaft; it felt the earthquake’s thrill,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Clung to its base and greets the sunrise still.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Stick to your aim; the mongrel’s hold will slip,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  But only crowbars loose the bulldog’s grip;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Small as he looks, the jaw that never yields<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  Drags down the bellowing monarch of the fields.’”<br/>
</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink05'>CHAPTER V.—NATURE’S NOBLEMAN.</h2>

<p>Frank found the Twin Star Ranch a pleasant place.
The house was large and well furnished, everything being
in far better taste than he had expected.</p>

<p>Merry knew something of ranches and ranch life
which, however, he said nothing about. He was supposed
to be a very tender tenderfoot. Nobody dreamed
he had ever handled a lariat, ridden a bucking broncho,
or taken part in a round-up.</p>

<p>Gallup roamed about the ranch, inspecting everything,
and he was a source of constant amusement to the
“punchers,” as the cowboys were called.</p>

<p>After one of these tours of inspection, he came back
to the room where Frank and Bart were sitting, filled
with amazement.</p>

<p>“Vermont farms are different from this one,” smiled
Merry.</p>

<p>“Waal, naow yeou’re talkin’! I’d like ter know haow
they ever do the milkin’ here. I don’t b’lieve all ther
men they’ve got kin milk so menny caows. Why, I saw
a hull drove of more’n five hundred cattle about here on
the farm, an’ they told me them warn’t a pinch of what
Mr. Carson owns. Gosh all hemlock! but he must be
rich!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Carson seems to be pretty well fixed,” said
Merry.</p>

<p>“That’s so. He’s got a fine place here, only it’s too
gol-dinged mernoternous.”</p>

<p>“Monotonous? How?”</p>

<p>“The graound’s too flat. Ain’t any hills to rest a feller’s
eyes ag’inst. I tell yeou it does a man good to go
aout where he kin see somethin’ besides a lot of flatness
an’ sky. There ain’t northin’ in the world purtier than
the Varmount hills. In summer they’re all green an’
covered with grass an’ trees, an’ daown in the valleys
is the streams an’ rivers runnin’ along, sometimes swift
an’ foamin’, sometimes slow an’ smooth, like glars. An’
ther cattle are feedin’ on ther hills, an’ ther folks are
to work on their farms, an’ ther farm haouses, all painted
white, are somethin’ purty ter see. They jest do a man’s
heart an’ soul good. An’ then when it is good summer
weather in Varmount, I be dad-bimmed if there’s any
better weather nowhere! Ther sun jest shines right
daown as if it was glad to git a look at sech a purty
country, an’ ther sky’s as blue as Elsie Bellwood’s eyes.
Ther birds are singin’ in ther trees, an’ ther bees go
hummin’ in ther clover fields, an’ there’s sich a gol-durn
good feelin’ gits inter a feller that he jest wants ter
larf an’ shaout all ther time. Aout here there ain’t
no trees fer ther birds ter sing in, an’ there don’t seem
ter be northin’ but flat graound an’ cattle an’ sky.”</p>

<p>Frank had been listening with interest to the words of
the country boy. A lover of nature himself, Merry realized
that Gallup’s soul had been deeply impressed by the
fair features of nature around his country home.</p>

<p>“Yes, Ephraim,” he said, “Vermont is very picturesque
and beautiful. The Vermont hills are something
once seen never to be forgotten.”</p>

<p>Gallup was warmed up over his subject.</p>

<p>“But when it comes to daownright purtiness,” he
went on, “there ain’t northing like Varmount in the fall
fer that. Then ev’ry day yeou kin see ther purtiest sights
human eyes ever saw. Then is the time them hills is
wuth seein’. First the leaves on ther maples, an’
beeches, an’ oaks they begin ter turn yaller an’ red a
little bit. Then ther frost comes more, an’ them leaves
turn red an’ gold till it seems that ther hull sides of them
hills is jest like a purty painted picter. The green of the
cedars an’ furs jest orfsets the yaller an’ gold. Where
there is rocks on the hills, they seem to turn purple an’
blue in the fall, an’ they look purty, too—purtier’n they
do at any other time. I uster jest go aout an’ set right
daown an’ look at them air hills by the hour, an’ I uster
say to myself I didn’t see haow heaven could be any
purtier than the Varmount hills in ther fall.</p>

<p>“But there was folks,” he went on, whut lived right
there where all them purty sights was an’ never saw
um. They warn’t blind, neither. I know some folks I
spoke to abaout how purty the hills looked told me they
hedn’t noticed um! Naow, what du yeou think of that?
I’ve even hed folks tell me they couldn’t see northin’
purty abaout um! Naow whut do yeou think of that? I
ruther guess them folks missed half ther fun of livin’.
They was born with somethin’ ther matter with um.</p>

<p>“It uster do me good ter take my old muzzle-loadin’
gun an’ go aout in the woods trampin’ in the fall. I
uster like ter walk where the leaves hed fell jest to hear
um rustle. I’d give a dollar this minute ter walk
through the fallen leaves in the Varmount woods! I
didn’t go out ter shoot things so much as I did to see
things. There was plenty of squirrels, but I never shot
but one red squirrel in my life. He come aout on the
end of a limb clost to me an’ chittered at me in a real
jolly way, same’s to say, ‘Hello, young feller! Ain’t this a
fine day? Ain’t yeou glad yeou’re livin’?’ An’ then I up
an’ shot him, like a gol-durn pirut!”</p>

<p>Ephraim stopped and choked a little. Bart was
looking at him now with a strange expression on his face.
Frank did not speak, but he was fully in sympathy with
the tender-hearted country youth.</p>

<p>Bart rose to his feet, heaving a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I missed some things when I was a boy,”
he said. “There were plenty of woods for me, but I
never found any pleasure in them. I used to think it fun
to shoot squirrels; but now I believe it would have been
greater pleasure for me if I had not shot them. I never
listened to the music of the woods, for I didn’t know
there was any music in them. Gallup, you have shown
me that I was a fool.”</p>

<p>Then, with his hands thrust deep into his pockets, he
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Because Ephraim was very verdant the cowboys on
the Twin Star fancied that Mr. Carson’s other visitors
must be equally as accustomed to Western ways.</p>

<p>Frank was hard at work on his play, and that caused
him to stick pretty close to the house. However, he
was a person who believed in exercise when he could
find it, and so, on the afternoon of the second day, he
went out and asked one of the punchers if he could
have a pony.</p>

<p>The man looked him over without being able to
wholly conceal his contempt.</p>

<p>“Kin you ride?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Frank, quietly.</p>

<p>“Hawse or kaow?” asked the cowboy.</p>

<p>“If you have a good saddle horse, I’d like to have
him,” said Merry. “And be good enough to restrain
your sarcasm. I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>The puncher gasped. He was angry. The idea of a
tenderfoot speaking to him in such a way!</p>

<p>“All right,” he muttered. “I’ll git ye a critter, but
our Western hawses ain’t like your Eastern ladies’
hawses.”</p>

<p>He departed.</p>

<p>Hodge had overheard all this, and he came up.</p>

<p>“You want to look out, Merry,” he said. “That chap
didn’t like the way you called him down, and he’ll bring
you a vicious animal.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” nodded Merry, pulling on a pair of heavy
gloves. “It is what I expect.”</p>

<p>Bart said no more. He had seen Merry ride, and he
knew Frank was a natural horse breaker.</p>

<p>The puncher returned in a short time, leading a little,
wiry, evil-eyed broncho. He was followed by several
other cowboys, and Merry heard one of them say:</p>

<p>“Better not let him try it, Hough. He’ll be killed,
and Carson will fire you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll warn him,” returned the one called Hough, “an’
then I won’t be ter blame. He wants ter ride; let him
ride—if he kin.”</p>

<p>Frank looked the broncho over.</p>

<p>“Is this the best saddle horse you have?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Waal, he’s the only one handy now,” was the sullen
answer. “He’s a bit onreliable at times, an’ you’d better
look out fer him. I wouldn’t recommend him for a
lady ter ride.”</p>

<p>“By that I presume you mean he is a bucker?”</p>

<p>“Waal, he may buck some!” admitted the puncher,
surprised that Frank should ask such a question.</p>

<p>“You haven’t anything but a hackamore on him,”
said Merry. “Why didn’t you put a bit in his mouth?
Do people usually ride with hackamores out here?”</p>

<p>“He kinder objects to a bit,” confessed the cowboy,
his surprise increasing. “People out here ride with any
old thing. Mebbe you hadn’t better try him.”</p>

<p>“Has he ever been ridden?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“You give your word to that?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“All right. Then I’ll ride him.”</p>

<p>Frank went into the saddle before the puncher was
aware that he contemplated such a thing. He yanked
the halter out of the man’s hand, who leaped aside, with
a cry of surprise and fear, barely escaping being hit by
the broncho’s heels, for the creature wheeled and kicked,
with a shrill scream.</p>

<p>Frank was entirely undisturbed. He had put on a
pair of spurred riding boots which he found in the
house, and now the broncho felt the prick of the spurs.</p>

<p>Then the broncho began to buck. Down went his
head, and up into the air went his heels; down came
his heels, and up went his head. Then he came down
on all fours, and his entire body shot into the air. He
came down stiff-legged, his back humped. Again and
again he did this, with his nose between his knees, but
still the tenderfoot remained in the saddle.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” cried the wondering cowboys.</p>

<p>Bart Hodge stood at one side, his hands in his pockets,
a look of quiet confidence on his face.</p>

<p>From an upper window of the ranch a pretty, sad-faced
girl looked out, seeing everything. Frank had
noticed her just before mounting the broncho. He wondered
not a little, for up to that moment he had known
nothing of such a girl being there. He had not seen
her before since coming to the ranch.</p>

<p>All at once the broncho began to “pitch a-plunging,”
jumping forward as he bucked. He stopped short and
whirled end-for-end, bringing his nose where his tail
was a moment before. He did that as he leaped into the
air. Then he began to go up and down fore and aft
with a decidedly nasty motion. He screamed his rage.
He pitched first on one side and then on the other, letting
his shoulders alternately jerk up and droop down almost
to the ground.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” cried the cowboys again, for through
all this Frank Merriwell sat firmly in the saddle.</p>

<p>“Is this yere your tenderfoot what yer told us ye was
goin’ ter learn a lesson, Hough?” they asked.</p>

<p>“Waal, I’ll be blowed!” was all the reply Hough made.</p>

<p>The broncho pitched “fence-cornered,” but even that
had no effect on the rider.</p>

<p>Hough told the truth when he said the animal had
been ridden before. Realizing at last the fruitlessness
of its efforts, it suddenly ceased all attempts to unseat
Frank. Two minutes later Merriwell was riding away
on the creature’s back, and Hough, the discomfited cowboy,
was the laughing-stock of the Twin Star Ranch.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink06'>CHAPTER VI.—A CHANGE OF NAME.</h2>

<p>At the open upper window of the ranch the sad-faced,
pretty girl watched and waited till Frank Merriwell came
riding back over the prairie.</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” she whispered. “He is handsome—so
handsome! He is the first man I have seen who
could be compared with Lawton.”</p>

<p>Kent Carson had heard of Frank’s departure on Wildfire,
the bucking broncho. He found it difficult to believe
that his guest had really ridden away on the animal,
and he was on hand, together with Bart and Ephraim,
when Merry came riding back.</p>

<p>Near one of the corrals a group of cowboys had gathered
to watch the remarkable tenderfoot, and make sarcastic
remarks to Hough, who was with them, looking
sulky and disgusted.</p>

<p>Mr. Carson hurried to greet Frank.</p>

<p>“Look here, young man,” he cried, “I’d like to know
where you ever learned to ride bucking bronchos?”</p>

<p>“This is not the first time I have been on a cattle
ranch, Mr. Carson,” smiled Frank, springing down
from Wildfire.</p>

<p>One of the cowboys came shuffling forward. It was
Hough.</p>

<p>“Say, tenderfoot,” he said, keeping his eyes on the
ground, “I allows that I made some onnecessary remarks
ter you a while ago. I kinder hinted as how you might
ride a kaow bettern a hawse. I’ll take it all back. You
may be a tenderfoot, but you knows how ter ride as
well as any of us. I said some things what I hadn’t
oughter said, an’ I swallers it all.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” laughed Frank, good-naturedly.
“You may have had good reasons for regarding tenderfeet
with contempt, but now you will know all tenderfeet
are not alike. I don’t hold feelings.”</p>

<p>“Thankee,” said Hough, as he led Wildfire away.</p>

<p>Frank glanced up toward the open window above and
again he caught a glimpse of that sad, sweet face.</p>

<p>Mr. Carson shook hands with Frank.</p>

<p>“Now I know you are the kind of chap to succeed in
life,” he declared. “I can see that you do whatever
you undertake to do. I am beginning to understand better
and better how it happened that my boy thought so
much of you.”</p>

<p>He took Frank by the arm, and together they walked
toward the house. Again Merry glanced upward, but,
somewhat to his disappointment, that face had vanished.</p>

<p>It was after supper that Merry and Hodge were sitting
alone on the veranda in front of the house, when
Bart suddenly said, in a low tone:</p>

<p>“Merriwell, I have a fancy that there is something
mysterious about this place.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Frank. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“I think there is some one in one of those upper
rooms who is never seen by the rest of the people about
the place.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p>“There is a room up there that I’ve never seen anyone
enter or leave. The door is always closed. Twice while
passing the door I have heard strange sounds coming
from that room.”</p>

<p>“This grows interesting,” admitted Frank. “Go on.”</p>

<p>“The first time,” said Bart, “I heard some one in there
weeping and sobbing as if her heart would break.”</p>

<p>“Her heart?” came quickly from Merry’s lips.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then it is a female?”</p>

<p>“Beyond a doubt. The second time I heard sounds in
that room to-day after you rode away on the broncho. I
heard some one singing in there.”</p>

<p>“Singing?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was a love song. The voice was very
sad and sweet, and still there seemed something of happiness
in it.”</p>

<p>Hodge was silent.</p>

<p>“Well, you have stumbled on a mystery,” nodded
Frank, slowly. “What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to make of it, unless some friend
or relative of Carson’s is confined in that room.”</p>

<p>“Why confined there?”</p>

<p>“You know as well as I do.”</p>

<p>Frank opened his lips to say something about the face
he had seen at the window, but at that moment Carson
himself came out onto the veranda, smoking his pipe.
The rancher took a chair near, and they chatted away as
twilight and darkness came on.</p>

<p>“How are you getting along on your play, Mr. Merriwell?”
asked the man.</p>

<p>“Very well.” answered Frank. “You know it is a
drama of college life—life at Yale?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know about that.”</p>

<p>“It is. Just now I am puzzled most to find a name for
it.”</p>

<p>“What was the name before?”</p>

<p>“‘For Old Eli.’”</p>

<p>“U-hum. Who was Old Eli?”</p>

<p>“There!” cried Merry. “That shows me there is a
fault with the name. Even though your boy is in Yale,
you do not know that Yale College is affectionately
spoken of by Yale men as ‘Old Eli.’”</p>

<p>“No, never knew it before; though, come to think
about it, Berlin did write something in some of his letters
about Old Eli. I didn’t understand it, though.”</p>

<p>“And the public in general do not understand the title
of my play. They suppose Old Eli must be a character in
the piece, and I do not fancy there is anything catching
and drawing about the title. I must have a new title,
and I’m stuck to find one that will exactly fit.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you must have one that has some reference
to college?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! That is what I want. One that brings
Yale in somehow.”</p>

<p>“All you Yale men seem to be stuck on that college.
You’re true blue.”</p>

<p>Frank leaped to his feet with a cry of delight.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What?” gasped Mr. Carson.</p>

<p>“The title!”</p>

<p>“You have?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you gave it to me then!”</p>

<p>“I did?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“‘True Blue.’ That is a title that fits the play. Yale’s
color is blue, you know. People may not understand just
what the title means, but still I believe there is something
attractive about it, something that will draw, and the audience
will understand it before the play is over. ‘True
Blue’ is the name! I have been well paid for coming out
here, Mr. Carson! Besides entertaining me royally, you
have given me a striking name for my play.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure I’m glad if I’ve done that,” laughed
Kent Carson.</p>

<p>“I must put that title down on the manuscript,” said
Frank. “I feel an inspiration. I must go to work at
once. I am in the mood now, and I can write.”</p>

<p>Excusing himself, he hurried into the house. Soon
a light gleamed from the window of the room in which
he worked, which was on the ground floor. Looking
in at that window, Hodge saw Frank had started a fire
in the grate and lighted a lamp. He was seated at a
table, writing away swiftly.</p>

<p>Kent Carson got up and stood beside Hodge looking
into the room.</p>

<p>“Merriwell is a great worker,” said the rancher.</p>

<p>“He’s a steam engine,” declared Bart. “I never saw
a fellow who could do so much work and so many
things. There is no telling how long he will drive away
at that play to-night. Now that he has the title, he may
finish it to-night, and be ready to leave here in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“If that happens, I shall be sorry I gave the title so
soon,” said the cattleman, sincerely. “I have taken a
great liking to that young man.”</p>

<p>Frank worked away a long time, utterly unconscious
of the flight of the hours. At last he became aware
that the fire in the open grate had made the room uncomfortably
warm. He had replenished it several times,
as there was something wonderfully cheerful in an open
fire. He arose and flung wide the window.</p>

<p>The moon, a thin, shining scimitar, was low down in
the west. Soon it would drop from view beyond the
horizon. There was a haze on the plain. Slowly out
of that haze came two objects that seemed to be approaching.</p>

<p>“Cattle,” said Merry, turning back from the window
and sitting down at the table again.</p>

<p>He resumed work on the play. He did not hear the
door open softly, he did not hear a light footstep behind
him, he did not hear a rustling sound quite near,
and it was not until a deep, tremulous sigh reached his
ears that he became aware of another presence in the
room.</p>

<p>Like a flash Frank whirled about and found himself
face to face with——</p>

<p>The girl he had seen at the window!</p>

<p>In astonishment Frank gazed at the girl, who was
dressed in some dark material, as if she were in mourning.
He saw that she was quite as pretty as he had
fancied at first, although her face was very pale and
sad. The color of her dress and hair made her face
seem paler than it really was.</p>

<p>Only a moment did Frank remain thus. Then he
sprang up, bowing politely, and saying:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon! I did not know there was a lady
in the room.”</p>

<p>She bowed in return.</p>

<p>“Do not rise,” she said. “I saw you to-day from
my window, and I could not sleep till I had seen you
again. Somehow you seemed to remind me of Lawton.
I thought so, then, but now it does not seem so much
that way. Still you made me think of him. I have been
shut up there so long—so long! I have not talked to
anybody, and I wanted to talk to somebody who could
tell me something of the world—something of the places
far away. I am buried here, where nobody knows anything
to talk about but cattle and horses.”</p>

<p>Frank’s heart was thrilled with sympathy.</p>

<p>“Do they keep you shut up in that room?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No; I stay there from choice. This is the first time
I have been downstairs for weeks. I have refused to
leave the room; I refused to see my father. I can’t bear
to have him look at me with such pity and anger.”</p>

<p>“Your father—he is Mr. Carson?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It is strange he has never spoken to me of you. I
was not aware he had a daughter, although he spoke
proudly of his son.”</p>

<p>In an instant Frank regretted his words. A look
of anguish swept over the face of the girl, and she fell
back a step, one thin hand fluttering up to her bosom.</p>

<p>“No!” she cried, and her voice was like the sob of
the wind beneath the leaves of a deserted house; “he
never speaks of me! He says I am dead—dead to the
world. He is proud of his son, Berlin, my brother; but
he is ashamed of his daughter, Blanche.”</p>

<p>Frank began to suspect and understand the truth.
This girl had met with some great sorrow, a sorrow that
had wrecked her life. Instantly Merry’s heart was overflowing
with sympathy, but his situation was most
embarrassing, and he knew not what to say. The girl
seemed to understand this.</p>

<p>“Don’t think me crazy because I have come here
to you in this way,” she entreated. “Don’t think me
bold! Oh, if you could know how I have longed for
somebody with whom I could talk! I saw you were a
gentleman. I knew my father would not introduce me to
you, but I resolved to see you, hoping you would talk to
me—hoping you would tell me of the things going on in
the world.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to do so,” said Merry, gently. “But
don’t you have any papers, any letters, anything to tell
you the things you wish to know?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—nothing! I am dead to the world. You
were writing. Have I interrupted you?”</p>

<p>“No; I am through working on my play to-night.”</p>

<p>“Your play?” she cried, eagerly. “What are you doing
with a play? Perhaps—perhaps——”</p>

<p>She stopped speaking, seeming to make an effort to
hold her eagerness in check.</p>

<p>“I am writing a play,” Frank explained. “That is,
I am rewriting it now. I wrote it some time ago and
put it on the road, but it was a failure. I am going out
again soon with a new company.”</p>

<p>Her eagerness seemed to increase.</p>

<p>“Then you must know many actors,” she said. “Perhaps
you know him?”</p>

<p>“Know whom?”</p>

<p>“Lawton—Lawton Kilgore.”</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.</p>

<p>“Never heard of him.”</p>

<p>She showed great disappointment.</p>

<p>“I am so sorry,” she said. “I hoped you might be able
to tell me something about him. If you can tell me
nothing, I must tell you. I must talk to somebody. You
see how it is. Mother is dead. Father sent me to school
in the East. It was there that I met Lawton. He was
so handsome! He was the leading man in a company
that I saw. Then, after the company disbanded for
the season, he came back to spend the summer in the
town where I was at school. I suppose I was foolish, but
fell in love with him. We were together a great deal.
We became engaged.”</p>

<p>Frank fancied he knew what was coming. The girl
was skipping over the story as lightly as possible, but
she was letting him understand it all.</p>

<p>“I didn’t write father about it,” she went on, “for I
knew he would not approve of Lawton. He wanted
me to marry Brandon King, who owns the Silver Forks
Ranch. I did not love King. I loved Lawton Kilgore.
But the principal of the school found out what was
going on, and he wrote father. Then Lawton disappeared,
and I heard nothing from him. They say he
deserted me. I do not believe it. I think he was driven
away. I waited and waited for him, but I could not
study, I could not do anything. He never came back,
and, at last, father came and took me away. He brought
me here. He was ashamed of me, but he said he would
not leave me to starve, for I was his own daughter.
His kindness was cruel, for he cut me off from the world.
Still I believe that some day Lawton will come for me
and take me away from here. I believe he will come—if
they have not killed him!”</p>

<p>She whispered the final words.</p>

<p>“They? Who?” asked Frank, startled.</p>

<p>“My father and my brother,” she answered. “They
were furious enough to kill him. They swore they
would.”</p>

<p>She had told Merry her story, and she seemed to feel
relieved. She asked him many questions about the actors
he knew. He said he had the pictures of nearly
all who had taken parts in his two plays. She asked to
see them, and he brought them out from his large traveling
case, showing them to her one by one. She looked
at them all with interest.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, she gave a low, sharp cry. Her hand
darted out and caught up one of the photographs.</p>

<p>“Here—here!——” she panted. “You have his picture
here! This is Lawton Kilgore—Lawton, my lover!”</p>

<p>It was the picture of Leslie Lawrence!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink07'>CHAPTER VII.—THE TRAGEDY AT THE RANCH.</h2>

<p>“That?” exclaimed Frank. “You must be mistaken!
That man’s name is not Kilgore, it is Lawrence.”</p>

<p>He fancied the girl was crazy. He had wondered if
her misfortune had affected her brain.</p>

<p>“This is the picture of Lawton Kilgore!” she repeated,
in a dull tone.</p>

<p>“Do you think I would not know him anywhere—under
any circumstances? This is the man who promised
to marry me! This is the man my father hates as he
hates a snake!”</p>

<p>“Well, that man is worthy of your father’s hatred,”
said Merry, “for he is a thoroughbred villain. But I
think you must be mistaken, for your father met him in
Denver. This man had me arrested, and your father
followed to the police station, and was instrumental in
securing my release. If this man was Kilgore, your
father would have found his opportunity to kill him.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand,” panted the girl. “Father
has never seen him to know him—has never even seen
his picture. If Lawton was known by another name,
father would not have recognized him, even though they
met in Denver.”</p>

<p>Frank began to realize that the girl was talking in a
sensible manner, and something told him she spoke the
truth. To his other crimes, Lawrence had added that
of deceiving an innocent girl.</p>

<p>“And he is in Denver?” panted the rancher’s daughter.
“He is so near! Oh, if he would come to me!”</p>

<p>Frank was sorry that he had permitted her to see
the photographs, but it was too late now for regrets.</p>

<p>The girl pressed the picture to her lips.</p>

<p>“You must give it to me!” she panted. “I will take it
to my room! I wish to be alone with it at once! Oh,
I thank you!”</p>

<p>Then she hurried from the room, leaving Merry in
anything but a pleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>There was a sound outside the window. Frank got up
and went over to the window. Looking out, he saw two
horses standing at a little distance from the ranch. A
man was holding them, and the faint light of the moon
fell on the man’s face.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder what that means?” speculated Frank.
“Those horses are saddled and bridled. Who is going
to ride them to-night?”</p>

<p>Then he remembered the two forms he had seen
coming out of the mist that lay on the plain, and he
wondered if they had not been two horsemen.</p>

<p>Something about the appearance of the man at the
heads of the horses seemed familiar. He looked closer.</p>

<p>“About the size and build of Lloyd Fowler,” he muttered.
“Looks like Fowler, but of course it is not.”</p>

<p>There was a step on the veranda, and a figure appeared
at the open window. Into the room stepped a man.</p>

<p>Frank sprang back, and was face to face with the intruder.</p>

<p>“Leslie Lawrence!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the man, advancing insolently; “I am
Leslie Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I want an engagement in your new company. I have
come here for it. Will you give it to me?”</p>

<p>Frank was astounded by the insolence of the fellow.</p>

<p>“I should say not!” he exclaimed. “What do you take
me for? No, Leslie Lawrence, alias Lawton Kilgore,
villain, deceiver of innocent girls, wretch who deserves
hanging, I will not give you an engagement, unless it is
with an outraged father. Go! If you wish to live, leave
instantly. If Kent Carson finds you here, he will know
you now, and your life will not be worth a cent!”</p>

<p>At this moment the door was flung open, and Ephraim
Gallup came striding into the room, saying as he entered:</p>

<p>“Darned if I knowed there was a purty young gal in
this haouse! Thought I’d come daown, Frank, an’ see
if yeou was goin’ to stay up all night writin’ on that
play of—— Waal, I be gosh-blamed!”</p>

<p>Ephraim saw Lawrence, and he was astounded.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know yeou hed visitors, Frank,” he said.</p>

<p>“So you refuse me an engagement, do you, Merriwell?”
snarled Lawrence. “All right! You’ll wish
you hadn’t in a minute!”</p>

<p>He made a spring for the table and caught up the
manuscript lying on it. Then he leaped toward the open
grate, where the fire was burning.</p>

<p>“That’s the last of your old play!” he shouted, hurling
the manuscript into the flames.</p>

<p>Both Frank and Ephraim sprang to save the play,
but neither of them was in time to prevent Lawrence’s
revengeful act.</p>

<p>“You miserable cur!” panted Frank.</p>

<p>Out shot his fist, striking the fellow under the ear,
and knocking him down.</p>

<p>At the same time Ephraim snatched the manuscript
from the fire and beat out the flames which had fastened
on it.</p>

<p>Lawrence sat up, his hand going round to his hip.
He wrenched out a revolver and lifted it.</p>

<p>Frank saw the gleam of the weapon, realized his danger,
and dropped an instant before the pistol spoke.</p>

<p>The shot rang out, but even as he pressed the trigger,
Lawrence realized that Merriwell had escaped. But
beyond Frank, directly in line, he saw a pale-faced girl
who had suddenly appeared in the open door. He
heard her cry “Lawton!” and then, through the puff
of smoke, he saw her clutch her breast and fall on the
threshold, shot down by his own hand!</p>

<p>Horror and fear enabled him to spring up, plunge out
of the open window, reach the horses, leap on one and
go thundering away toward the moonlight mists as if
Satan were at his heels.</p>

<p>There was a tumult at the Twin Star. There was hot
mounting to pursue Lawrence and his companion. Carson
had heard the shot. He had rushed down to find his
daughter, shot in the side, supported in the arms of
Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>A few words had told Carson just what had happened.</p>

<p>He swore a fearful oath to follow Lawrence to death.</p>

<p>The girl heard the oath. She opened her eyes and
whispered:</p>

<p>“Father—don’t! He didn’t mean—to shoot—me! It
was—an—accident!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have the whelp stiff at my feet before morning!”
vowed the revengeful rancher.</p>

<p>He gave orders for the preparing of horses. He saw
his daughter carried to her room. He lingered till the
old black housekeeper was at the bedside to bind up the
wound and do her best to save the girl.</p>

<p>Then Carson bounded down the stairs and sent a cowboy
flying off on horseback for the nearest doctor, a hundred
miles away.</p>

<p>“Kill the horse under ye, if necessary, Prescott!” he
had yelled at the cowboy. “Get the doctor here as quick
as you can!”</p>

<p>“All right, sir!” shouted Prescott, as he thundered
away.</p>

<p>“Now!” exclaimed Kent Carson—“now to follow that
murderous hound till I run him to earth!”</p>

<p>He found men and horses ready and waiting. He
found Frank Merriwell and Bart Hodge there, both of
them determined to take part in the pursuit.</p>

<p>“We know him,” said Merriwell. “He fired that shot
at me. We can identify him.”</p>

<p>Frank believed that Lawrence had murdered the rancher’s
daughter, and he, like the others, was eager to run
the wretch down.</p>

<p>They galloped away in pursuit, the rancher, four cowboys,
Merriwell and Hodge, all armed, all grim-faced,
all determined.</p>

<p>The sun had risen when they came riding back to the
ranch. Ephraim Gallup met Frank.</p>

<p>“Did ye git ther critter?” he asked, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then he got erway?” came in accents of disappointment
from the Vermonter.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Whut? Haow’s that?”</p>

<p>“Neither Lawrence nor Fowler escaped.”</p>

<p>“Then it was Fowler with him?”</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>“Whut happened to um?”</p>

<p>“They attempted to ford Big Sandy River.”</p>

<p>“An’ got drownded?”</p>

<p>“No. Where they tried to cross is nothing but a bed
of quicksands. Horses and men went down into the
quicksands. They were swallowed up forever.”</p>

<p>The doctor came at last. He extracted the bullet from
Blanche Carson’s side, and he told her she would get
well, as the wound was not dangerous.</p>

<p>Kent Carson heard this with deep relief. He went
to the bedside of the girl and knelt down there.</p>

<p>“Blanche,” he whispered, huskily, “can you forgive
your old dad for treating you as he has? You are my
own girl—my little Blanche—no matter what you have
done.”</p>

<p>“Father!” she whispered, in return, “I am glad you
have come to me at last. But you know you are ashamed
of me—you can never forget what I have done.”</p>

<p>“I can forget now,” he declared, thinking of the man
under the quicksands of Big Sandy. “You are my
daughter. I am not ashamed of you. You shall never
again have cause for saying that of me.”</p>

<p>“Kiss me, papa!” she murmured.</p>

<p>Sobbing brokenly, he pressed his lips to her cheeks.</p>

<p>And when he was gone from the room she took a
photograph from beneath her pillow and gazed at it long
and lovingly.</p>

<p>She knew not that the man had been swallowed beneath
the quicksands of the Big Sandy.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>The tragic occurrences of the night hastened the departure
of Frank and his friends from Twin Star Ranch,
although Kent Carson urged them to remain. Frank
had, however, finished his play, which, thanks to the
prompt act of Ephraim, had been only slightly injured
by its fiery experience, and was anxious to put it in rehearsal.</p>

<p>So, a day or so later, Frank, Bart and Ephraim were
once more in Denver.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink08'>CHAPTER VIII.—THE OLD ACTOR’S CHAMPIONS.</h2>

<p>Along a street of Denver walked a man whose appearance
was such as to attract attention wherever seen.
That he had once been an actor could be told at a glance,
and that he had essayed great rôles was also apparent.
But, alas! it was also evident that the time when this
Thespian trod the boards had departed forever, and with
that time his glory had vanished.</p>

<p>His ancient silk hat, although carefully brushed, was
shabby and grotesque in appearance. His Prince Albert
coat, buttoned tight at the waist, and left open at the
bosom, was shabby and shining, although it also betokened
that, with much effort, he had kept it clean. His
trousers bagged at the knees, and there were signs of
mannish sewing where two or three rents and breaks
had been mended. The legs of the trousers were very
small, setting tightly about his thin calves. His shoes
were in the worst condition of all. Although they had
been carefully blackened and industriously polished, it
was plain that they could not hold together much longer.
The soles were almost completely worn away, and the
uppers were breaking and ripping. The “linen” of this
frayed gentleman seemed spotlessly white. His black
silk necktie was knotted in a broad bow.</p>

<p>The man’s face was rather striking in appearance.
The eyes had once been clear and piercing, the mouth
firm and well formed; but there was that about the
chin which belied the firmness of the mouth, for this
feature showed weakness. The head was broad at the
top, with a high, wide brow. The eyes were set so far
back beneath the bushy, grayish eyebrows that they
seemed like red coals glowing in dark caverns—for
red they were and bloodshot. The man’s long hair fell
upon the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>And on his face was set the betraying marks of the
vice that had wrought his downfall. The bloodshot eyes
alone did not reveal it, but the purplish, unhealthy flush
of the entire face and neck plainly indicated that the demon
drink had fastened its death clutch upon him and
dragged him down from the path that led to the consummation
of all his hopes and aspirations.</p>

<p>He had been drinking now. His unsteady step told
that. He needed the aid of his cane in order to keep on
his feet. He slipped, his hat fell off, rolled over and
over, dropped into the gutter, and lay there.</p>

<p>The unfortunate man looked round for the hat, but it
was some time before he found it. When he did, in attempting
to pick it up, he fell over in the gutter and
rolled upon it, soiling his clothes. At last, with a great
effort, he gathered himself up, and rose unsteadily to his
feet with his hat and cane.</p>

<p>“What, ho!” he muttered, thickly. “It seems the world
hath grown strangely unsteady, but, perchance, it may
be my feet.”</p>

<p>Some boys who had seen him fall shouted and laughed
at him. He looked toward them sadly.</p>

<p>“Mock! mock! mock!” he cried. “Some of you
thoughtless brats may fall even lower than I have fallen!”</p>

<p>“Well, I like that—I don’t think!” exclaimed one of
the boys. “I don’t ’low no jagged stiff to call me a
brat!”</p>

<p>Then he threw a stone at the old actor, striking the
man on the cheek and cutting him slightly.</p>

<p>The unfortunate placed his crushed and soiled hat on
his head, took out a handkerchief, and slowly wiped a
little blood from his cheek, all the while swaying a bit,
as if the ground beneath his feet were tossing like a
ship.</p>

<p>“‘Now let it work,’” he quoted. “‘Mischief, thou
art afoot; take thou what course thou wilt. How now,
fellow?’”</p>

<p>The thoughtless young ruffians shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>“Looker the old duffer!” cried one. “Ain’t that a picture
fer yer!”</p>

<p>“Look!” exclaimed the actor. “Behold me with thy
eyes! Even lower than I have fallen may thou descend;
but I have aspired to heights of which thy sordid soul
may never dream. Out upon you, dog!”</p>

<p>With these words he reached the walk and turned
down the street.</p>

<p>“Let’s foller him!” cried one of the gang. “We can
have heaps of fun with him.”</p>

<p>“Come on! come on!”</p>

<p>With a wild whoop, they rushed after the man. They
reached him, danced around him, pulled his coat tails,
jostled him, crushed his hat over his eyes.</p>

<p>“Give the old duffer fits!” cried the leader, who was a
tough young thug of about eighteen.</p>

<p>There were seven boys in the gang, and four or five
others came up on the run, eager to have a hand in the
“racket.”</p>

<p>The old actor pushed his hat back from his eyes,
folded his arms over his out-thrown breast and gazed
with his red, sunken eyes at the leader. As if declaiming
on the stage he spoke:</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      “‘You have done that you should be sorry for.<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      For I am armed so strong in honesty<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      That they pass me by as the idle wind,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      Which I respect not.’”<br/>
</p>

<p>This caused the boys to shout with laughter.</p>

<p>“Git onter ther guy!”</p>

<p>“What ails him?”</p>

<p>“He’s locoed.”</p>

<p>“Loaded, you mean.”</p>

<p>“He’s cracked in the nut.”</p>

<p>“And he needs another crack on the nut,” shouted the
leader, dancing up, and again knocking the hat over the
old man’s eyes.</p>

<p>Once more pushing it back, the aged actor spoke in
his deep voice, made somewhat husky by drink:</p>

<p>“Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen and
lovers! hear me for my cause; and be silent that you
may hear; believe me for mine honor; and have respect
to mine honor, that you may believe; censure me in your
wisdom, and awaken your senses, that you may——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too much!” cried the ruffianly young
leader. “We can’t stand that kind of guy. What’re
yer givin’ us, anyway?”</p>

<p>“He’s drunk!” shouted several.</p>

<p>“Alas and alack!” sighed the old man. “I fear thou
speakest the truth.</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      “‘Boundless intemperance<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      In nature is a tyranny; it hath been<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      The untimely emptying of the happy throne,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      And the fall of many kings.’”<br/>
</p>

<p>“That’s what causes your fall,” declared the ruffianly
leader, as he tripped the actor, causing him to fall
heavily.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” exclaimed Frank Merriwell, who, with
Hodge for a companion, just returned from Twin Star
Ranch, at this moment came into view round a corner.
“What are those fellows doing to that poor man?”</p>

<p>“Raising hob with him,” said Bart, quickly. “The old
fellow is drunk and they are abusing him.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it’s time for us to take a hand in that!”</p>

<p>“I should say so!”</p>

<p>“Come on!”</p>

<p>Frank sprang forward; Bart followed.</p>

<p>The old actor was just making an effort to get up. The
young ruffian who led the gang kicked him over.</p>

<p>The sight made Frank’s blood leap.</p>

<p>“You cowardly young cur!” he cried, and he gave the
fellow a crack on the ear that sent him spinning.</p>

<p>Hodge struck out right and left, quickly sending two
of the largest fellows to the ground.</p>

<p>“Permit me to assist you, sir,” said Frank, stooping
to aid the actor to rise.</p>

<p>The leader of the gang had recovered. He uttered a
mad howl.</p>

<p>“At ’em fellers! Knock the stuffin’s outer them!” he
screamed, rushing on Frank.</p>

<p>Merry straightened up instantly. He whirled about
and saw the biggest tough coming at him, with the rest
of the gang at his back. Then Frank laughed.</p>

<p>“Walk right up, you young terriers!” he cried, in a
clear, ringing voice. “We’ll make it rather interesting
for you! Give it to them, Hodge!”</p>

<p>Hodge did so. Together the two friends met the onslaught
of the gang. Their hard fists cracked on the
heads of the young ruffians, and it was astonishing how
these fellows were bowled over. Bart was aroused. His
intense anger was betrayed by his knotted forehead, his
flashing eyes, and his gleaming teeth. He did not speak
a word, but he struck swift, strong and sure.</p>

<p>If those chaps had expected an easy thing with the
two well-dressed youths who had interfered with their
sport, they met the disappointment of their lives.</p>

<p>It actually seemed that, at one time, every one of the
gang had been knocked sprawling, and not one was on
his feet to face the fighting champions of the old actor.</p>

<p>It was a terrible surprise for the toughs. One after
another, they sprang up and took to their heels.</p>

<p>“What have we struck?” gasped the leader, looking
up at Frank.</p>

<p>“Get up!” invited Merry, standing over him—“get up,
and I will give you another dose!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me!” gasped the fellow, as he scrambled
away on his hands and knees, sprang up and followed
the rest of the young thugs.</p>

<p>It was over; the gang had been put to flight, and it
had been accomplished in a very few moments.</p>

<p>Hodge stood there, panting, glaring about, looking
surprised and disappointed, as well as angry.</p>

<p>“That was too easy!” he exclaimed. “I thought we
were in for a fight.”</p>

<p>“Evidently they did not stand for our kind of fighting,”
smiled Frank. “It surprised them so that they
threw up the sponge before the fight was fairly begun.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get half enough of it,” muttered Bart.</p>

<p>During the fight the old actor had risen to his feet.
Now Frank picked up his hat and restored it to him,
after brushing some dirt from it. The man received it
with a profound bow. Placing it on his head, he thrust
his right hand into the bosom of his coat, struck a pose,
and cried:</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      “‘Are yet two Romans living such as these?<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      The last of all the Romans!’”<br/>
</p>

<p>“We saw you were in trouble,” said Merry, “and we
hastened to give you such assistance as we could.”</p>

<p>“It was a goodly deed, a deed well done. Thy arms
are strong, thy hearts are bold. Methinks I see before
me two noble youths, fit to have lived in the days of
knighthood.”</p>

<p>“You are very complimentary,” smiled Frank, amused
at the old man’s quaint way.</p>

<p>The actor took his hand from his bosom and made a
deprecating gesture, saying:</p>

<p>“‘Nay, do not think I flatter; for what advancement
may I hope from thee?’ I but speak the thoughts my
heart bids me speak. I am old, the wreck of a once
noble man; yet you did not hesitate to stand by me in my
hour of need, even at peril to yourselves. I cannot reward
you. I can but offer the thanks of one whose
name it may be you have never heard—one whose name
to-day, but for himself and his own weakness, might be
on the tongues of the people of two continents. Gentlemen,
accept the thanks of William Shakespeare Burns.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Burns,” said Frank, “from your words, and your
manner, I am led to believe that you are an actor.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay. Once I trod the boards and interpreted the
characters of the immortal bard, for whom I was named.
That time is past. I am an actor no longer; I am a ‘has
been.’ My day is past, my sun hath set, and night
draweth on apace.”</p>

<p>“I thought I could not be mistaken,” said Frank.
“We, too, are actors, although not Shakespearian ones.”</p>

<p>“Is this true?” exclaimed the old tragedian. “And I
have been befriended by those who wouldst follow the
noble art! Brothers, I greet thee! But these are sad,
sad days, for the drama hath fallen into a decline. The
legitimate is scoffed at, the stage is defiled by the ribald
jest, the clownish low-comedy star, the dancing and singing
comedian, and vaudeville—ah, me! that we should
have fallen into such evil ways. The indecencies now
practiced in the name of art and the drama are enough
to make the immortal William turn in his grave. Oh,
for the good old days! But they are gone—forever
gone!”</p>

<p>“It seems strange to meet an actor like you ‘at liberty,’
and so far from the Rialto,” declared Merry.</p>

<p>“I have been touring the country, giving readings,”
Burns hastened to explain. “Ah, it is sad, sad! Once I
might have packed the largest theater of the metropolis;
to-day I am doing well if I bring out a round dozen to
listen to my readings at some crossroad schoolhouse in
the country. Thus have the mighty fallen!”</p>

<p>“I presume you are thinking of getting back to New
York?”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay. What my eyes have beheld there and my
ears have heard is enough. My heart is sick within me.
I was there at the opening of the season. One Broadway
theater was given over to burlesque of the very lowest
order, while another was but little better in character.
A leading theater close to Broadway was packed every
night by well-dressed people who went there to behold a
vile French farce, in which the leading lady disrobed
upon the stage. Ah, me! In truth, the world hath gone
wrong! The ways of men are evil, and all their thoughts
are vile. It is well that Shakespeare cannot rise from
his grave to look upon the horrors now perpetrated on
the English-speaking stage. If he were to be restored
to life and visit one of our theaters, I think his second
funeral would take place the following day. He would
die of heart failure.”</p>

<p>Frank laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“I believe you are right. It would give William a
shock, that is certain. But there are good modern plays,
you know.”</p>

<p>The actor shook his head.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” he declared. “I have not seen
them. If there is not something nasty in the play of to-day,
then it must of a certainty have its ‘effect’ in the
way of some mechanical contrivance—a horse race, a
steamboat explosion, a naval battle, or something of the
sort. It seems that a piece cannot survive on its merits
as a play, but must, perforce, be bolstered up by some
wretched device called an ‘effect.’”</p>

<p>“Truer words were never spoken,” admitted Frank.
“And still there are a few plays written to-day that do
not depend on such devices. In order to catch the
popular fancy, however, I have found it necessary to
introduce ‘effects.’”</p>

<p>“You speak as one experienced in the construction of
plays.”</p>

<p>“I have had some experience. I am about to start on
the road with my own company and my own play.”</p>

<p>Of a sudden Frank seemed struck by an idea.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he exclaimed. “Did you say you were
at liberty?”</p>

<p>“Just at present, yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, if I can get you, you are the very man I
want.”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>“Your play can contain no part I would care to interpret,”
he said, with apparent regret.</p>

<p>“But I think it is possible that you might be induced
to play the part. I had a man for it, but I lost him.
I was on my way to the Orpheum, to see if I could not
find another to fill his place.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a part is it?” asked Burns, plainly endeavoring
to conceal his eagerness.</p>

<p>“It is comedy.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the old actor, aghast and horrified.
“Wouldst offer me such a part? Dost think I—I who
have played <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Brutus</i>, <i>Lear</i> and <i>Othello</i>—would
stoop so low? ‘This is the most unkindest cut of all!’”</p>

<p>“But there is money in it—good, sure money. I have
several thousand dollars to back me, and I am going
out with my piece to make or break. I shall keep it on
the road several weeks, at any cost.”</p>

<p>The old actor shook his head.</p>

<p>“It cannot be,” he sadly said. “I am no comedian.
I could not play the part.”</p>

<p>“If you will but dress as you are, if you will add a
little that is fantastic to your natural acting, you can
play the part. It is that of a would-be tragedian—a
Shakespearian actor.”</p>

<p>“Worse and worse!” moaned the old man. “You
would have me burlesque myself! Out upon you!”</p>

<p>“I will pay you thirty-five dollars a week and railroad
expenses. How can you do better?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-fi——”</p>

<p>The old actor gasped for breath. He seemed unable
for some moments to speak. It was plain that the sum
seemed like a small fortune to him. At last his dignity
and his old nature reasserted itself.</p>

<p>“Young man,” he said, “dost know what thou hast
done? I—I am William Shakespeare Burns! A paltry
thirty-five per week! Bah! Go to!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll make it forty, and I can get a hundred
good men for that at this time of the season.”</p>

<p>The aged Thespian bowed his head. Slowly he spoke,
again quoting:</p>

<p>“Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you
make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem
to know my stops; you would pluck to the heart of my
mystery.”</p>

<p>“But the money, you seem to need that. Money is a
good thing to have.”</p>

<p>“‘Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.’ It
is true. Ah! but how can I thus lower myself?”</p>

<p>“As you have said, the good old days are past. It is
useless to live for them. Live for the present—and the
future. Money is base stuff, but we must have it. Come,
come; I know you can do the part. We’ll get along
splendidly.”</p>

<p>“‘Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.’
As Cassius saith, ‘Men at some time in their lives
are masters of their fates;’ but I think for me that time
is past. But forty dollars—ye gods!”</p>

<p>“It is better than reading to a scant dozen listeners at
crossroads schoolhouses.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well! You take advantage of my needs. I
accept. But I must have a dollar at once, with which to
purchase that which will drown the shame my heart doth
feel.”</p>

<p>“You shall have the dollar,” assured Frank. “Come
along with us, and we will complete arrangements.”</p>

<p>So the old actor was borne away, outwardly sad, but
inwardly congratulating himself on the greatest streak
of luck he had come upon in many moons.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink09'>CHAPTER IX.—WELCOME LETTERS.</h2>

<p>Frank Merriwell was determined to give a performance
of his revised play in Denver for advertising purposes.
He had the utmost confidence in “True Blue,” as
he had rechristened the piece, but the report of his failure
in Puelbo had spread afar in dramatic circles, being
carried broadcast by the Eastern dramatic papers, and
managers were shy of booking the revised version.</p>

<p>Some time before, after receiving the fortune from
the Carson City Bank, Merry had made a fair and equal
division, sending checks for their share to Browning,
Diamond and Rattleton. Toots’ share he had been unable
to forward, not knowing the address of the faithful
darky, who had been forced to go forth into the world
to win his way when Frank met with the misfortune that
caused him to leave Yale.</p>

<p>And now came three letters from three Yale men.
Diamond’s was brief.</p>

<div class='bq'>
<p>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Old Comrade</span>: It is plain you are still a practical
joker. Your very valuable (?) check on the First National of
Denver received. I really do not know what to do with so much
money! But I am afraid you are making a mistake by using a check
on an existing bank. Why didn’t you draw one on ‘The First Sand
Bank of Denver’? It would have served your purpose just as well.</p>

<p>“Can’t write much now, as I am making preparations for vacation,
which is only a month away. I’m afraid it will be a sorry
vacation for me this year; not much like the last one. Then we
were all together, and what times we did have at Fardale and in
Maine! I’m blue to-night, old friend, and do not feel like
writing. I fancy it has made me feel bluer than ever to read in
the <i>Dramatic Reflector</i> of your unfortunate failure in
Puelbo and the disbanding of your company after your backer
deserted you. Hard luck, Frank—hard luck! All the fellows have
been hoping you would make money enough to come back here in the
fall, but all that is over now.</p>

<p>“What are you doing? Can’t you find time to write to us and let
us know? We are very anxious about you. I will write you again
when I am more in the mood. Hoping your fortune may turn for the
better, I remain,</p>
</div>

<div class='bq'>
<p style='text-align:right; margin:0 4ex 0 auto'>“Always your friend,</p>
</div>

<div class='bq'>
<p style='text-align:right; margin:0 0ex 0 auto'>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Jack Diamond</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Frank read this aloud to Hodge and Gallup in his
room at the Metropole Hotel.</p>

<p>“Waal, by ginger!” exploded Ephraim. “What do yeou
think of that?”</p>

<p>“Now you see what your reputation as a practical
joker is doing for you, Merry,” said Hodge.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged if I don’t believe Diamond considers
it a joke!” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“Of course he does,” nodded Bart.</p>

<p>“Well, he is putting a joke on himself. He’ll be
somewhat surprised when he discovers that.”</p>

<p>Ephraim began to grin.</p>

<p>“That’s so, by thutter!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Here is a letter from Rattleton,” said Merry, picking
up another from the mail he had just received. “I wonder
how he takes it?”</p>

<p>“Read it and find aout,” advised Gallup.</p>

<p>“A wise suggestion,” bowed Frank, with mock gravity,
tearing it open.</p>

<p>This is what he read:</p>

<div class='bq'>
<p>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Merry</span>: Cheese it! What do you take us for—a lot of
chumps? We’re onto you! Eight thousand fiddlesticks! I’m going
to have the check framed and hang it in my room. It will be a
reminder of you.</p>

<p>“Say, that was tough about your fizzle in Puelbo! It came just
when we were hoping, you know. The fellows have been gathering
at the fence and talking about you and your return to college
since Browning came back and told us how you were making a
barrel of money with your play. Now the report of your disaster
is spread broadcast, and we know you cannot come back. It’s
tough.</p>

<p>“Diamond is in a blue funk. He hasn’t been half the man he was
since you went away. Hasn’t seemed to care much of anything
about studying or doing anything else, and, as a result, it is
pretty certain he’ll be dropped a class.</p>

<p>“But Diamond is not the only one. You know Browning was dropped
once. He is too lazy to study, but, in order to keep in your
class, he might have pulled through had you been here. Now it is
known for an almost certain thing that he will not be able to
pass exams, and you know what that means.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to say anything about myself. It’s dull here.
None of your friends took any interest in the college
theatricals last winter, and the show was on the bum. The whole
shooting match made a lot of guys of themselves.</p>

<p>“Baseball has been dead slow, so far this season. We are down in
the mud, with Princeton crowing. It takes you, Merry, to twist
the Tiger’s tail! What was the matter? Everything. All the
pitchers could do for us was to toss ’em up and get batted out
of the box. The new men were not in it. They had glass arms, and
the old reliables had dead wings. It was pitiful! I can’t write
any more about it.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you, Frank! Would I? Ask me! Oh, say! don’t you
think you can arrange it so you can come East this summer? Come
and see me. Say, come and stay all summer with me at my home! We
won’t do a thing but have a great time. Write to me and give me
your promise you will come. Don’t you refuse me, old man.</p>
</div>

<div class='bq'>
<p style='text-align:right; margin:0 4ex 0 auto'>“Yours till death,</p>

</div>

<p>“Here’s another!” cried Frank. “If that doesn’t beat!
Why, they all think those checks fakes!”</p>

<p>“As I said before,” said Hodge, “you see what your
reputation as a practical joker is doing for you.”</p>

<p>“I see,” nodded Frank. “It is giving me a chance to
get a big joke on those fellows. They will drop dead
when they learn those checks actually are good.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I should say yes!” nodded Ephraim. “Jest
naow they’re kainder thinkin’ yeou are an object fer
charity.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Browning’s letter.”</p>

<div class='bq'>
<p>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Mr. Frank Merriwell</span>, Millionaire and Philanthropist.</p>

<p>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Sir:</span> I seize my pen in my hand, being unable to seize
it with my foot, and hasten to acknowledge the receipt of
your princely gift. With my usual energy and haste, I dash off
these few lines at the rate of ten thousand words a minute, only
stopping to rest after each word. After cashing your check with
the pawnbroker, I shall use the few dollars remaining to settle
in part with my tailor, who has insisted in a most ungentlemanly
manner on the payment of his little bill, which has been running
but a short time—less than two years, I think. The sordid greed
and annoying persistence of this man has much embarrassed me,
and I would pay him off entirely, if it were not that I wish to
get my personal property out of my ‘uncle’s’ safe-deposit vault,
where it has been resting for some time.</p>

<p>“It is evident to me that you have money to burn in an open
grate. That is great, as Griswold would say. And it was so kind
of you to remember your old friends. The little hint
accompanying each check that thus you divided the spoils of our
great trip across the continent was not sufficient to deceive
anyone into the belief that this was other than a generous act
on your part and a free gift.</p>

<p>“There is not much news to write, save that everybody is in the
dumps and everything has turned blue. I suppose some of the
others will tell you all about things, so that will save me the
task, which you know I would intensely enjoy, as I do love to
work. It is the joy of my life to labor. I spend as much time as
possible each day working on a comfortable couch in my room; but
I will confess that I might not work quite so hard if it was not
necessary to draw at the pipe in order to smoke up.</p>

<p>“When are you coming East? Aren’t you getting tired of the West?
Why can’t you make a visit to Yale before vacation time? You
would be received with great <i>éclat</i>. Excuse my French. I
have to fling it around occasionally, when I can’t think of any
Latin or Greek. Why do you suppose Latin and Greek were
invented? Why didn’t those old duffers use English, and save us
poor devils no end of grinding?</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I have just upset the ink, and, having no more,
I must quit.</p>

<p style='text-align:right; margin:0 4ex 0 auto'>“Yours energetically,</p>

<p style='text-align:right; margin:0 0ex 0 auto'>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Bruce Browning</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Well, it’s simply marvelous that he stuck to it long
enough to write all that!” laughed Frank. “And he, like
the others, thinks the check a fake.”</p>

<p>Hodge got up and stood looking sullenly out of the
window.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Bart?” asked Merry, detecting
that there was something wrong.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” muttered the dark-faced fellow.</p>

<p>“Oh, come! Was there anything in those letters you
did not like?”</p>

<p>“No. It was something there was not in the letters.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Not one of those fellows even mentioned me!” cried
Hodge, fiercely whirling about. “I didn’t care a rap
about Diamond and Rattleton, but Browning would have
showed a trace of decency if he had said a word about
me. He made a bad blunder and was forced to confess
it, but I’ll bet he doesn’t think a whit more of me now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are too sensitive, old man. They did not
even write anything in particular for news, and think
how many of my friends at college they failed to mention.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well; they knew I was with you, and one of
them might have asked for me. I hope you may go
back to Yale, Merry, but wild horses could not drag
me back there! I hate them all!”</p>

<p>“Hate them, Hodge?”</p>

<p>“Yes, hate them!” Bart almost shouted. “They are a
lot of cads! There is not a whole man among them!”</p>

<p>Then he strode out of the room, giving the door a
bang behind him.</p>

<p>Of course Frank made haste to reply to the letters of
his college chums, assuring them that the checks were
perfectly good, and adding that, although he had some
reputation as a practical joker, he was not quite crazy
enough to utter a worthless check on a well-known bank,
as that would be a criminal act.</p>

<p>Frank mentioned Hodge, and, without saying so in so
many words, gave them to understand that Bart felt the
slight of not being spoken of in any of the letters from
his former acquaintances.</p>

<p>One thing Frank did not tell them, and that was that
he was on the point of starting out again with his play,
having renamed it, and rewritten it, and added a sensational
feature of the “spectacular” order in the view of a
boat race between Yale, Harvard and Cornell.</p>

<p>Even though he was venturing everything on the success
of the piece, Merry realized now better than ever
before that no man was so infallible that he could always
correctly foretell the fate of an untried play.</p>

<p>It is a great speculation to put a play on the road at
large expense. The oldest managers are sometimes deceived
in the value of a dramatic piece of property, and
it is not an infrequent thing that they lose thousands of
dollars in staging and producing a play in which they
have the greatest confidence, but which the theater-going
public absolutely refuses to accept.</p>

<p>Frank had been very confident that his second play
would be a winner in its original form, but disaster had
befallen it at the very start. He might have kept it on
the road as it stood, for, at the very moment when he
seemed hopelessly stranded without a dollar in the world,
fortune had smiled upon him by placing in his hands the
wealth which he had found in the Utah Desert at the time
of his bicycle tour across the continent.</p>

<p>But Merry had realized that, in the condition in which
it then stood, it was more than probable that the play
would prove an utter failure should he try to force it
upon the public.</p>

<p>This caused him to take prompt action. First he
brought the company to Denver, holding all of them,
save the two men who had caused him no small amount
of trouble, namely, Lloyd Fowler and Charlie Harper.</p>

<p>Calmly reviewing his play at Twin Star Ranch, Frank
decided that the comedy element was not strong enough
in the piece to make it a popular success on the road; accordingly
he introduced two new characters. It would
be necessary, in order to produce the effect that he desired,
to employ a number of “supers” in each place
where the play was given, as he did not believe he would
be warranted in the expense of carrying nonspeaking
characters with him.</p>

<p>On his return to Denver Frank had hastened at once
to look over the “mechanical effect” which had been constructed
for him. It was not quite completed, but was
coming on well, and, as far as Frank could see, had been
constructed perfectly according to directions and plans.</p>

<p>Of course, one man had not done the work alone. He
had been assisted by carpenters and scene painters, and
the work had been rushed.</p>

<p>Merry got his company together and began rehearsing
the revised play. His paper from Chicago came on, and
examination showed that it was quite “up to the mark.”
In fact, Havener, the stage manager, was delighted with
it, declaring that it was the most attractive stuff he had
seen in many years.</p>

<p>But for the loss of one of the actors he had engaged
to fill one of the comedy parts, Merry would have been
greatly pleased by the manner in which things moved
along.</p>

<p>Now, however, he believed that in William Shakespeare
Burns he had found a man who could fill the
place left vacant.</p>

<p>Although Hodge had been ready enough to defend
Burns from the young ruffians who were hectoring him
on the street, he had little faith in the man as a comedian.
Hodge could see no comedy in the old actor. To tell the
truth, it was seldom that Hodge could see comedy in
anything, and low comedy, sure to appeal to the masses,
he regarded as foolish.</p>

<p>For another reason Hodge felt uncertain about Burns.
It was plain that the aged tragedian was inclined to look
on the wine “when it was red,” and Bart feared he would
prove troublesome and unreliable on that account.</p>

<p>“I am done with the stuff!” Hodge had declared over
and over. “On that night in the ruffians’ den at Ace High
I swore never to touch it again, for I saw what brutes
it makes of men. I have little confidence in any man
who will drink it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, be a little more liberal,” entreated Frank. “You
know there are men who drink moderately, and it never
seems to harm them.”</p>

<p>“I know there are such men,” admitted Bart; “but
it is not blood that runs in their veins. It’s water.”</p>

<p>“Not all men are so hot-blooded and impulsive as you
and Jack Diamond.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of Diamond! I don’t think anything of
that fellow. I am talking about this Burns. He is a sot,
that’s plain. Drink has dragged him down so far that
all the powers in the world cannot lift him up. Some
night when everything depends on him, he will fail you,
for he will be too drunk to play his part. Then you
will be sorry that you had anything to do with him.”</p>

<p>“All the powers in this world might not be able to lift
him up,” admittted Frank; “but there are other powers
that can do so. I pity the poor, old man. He realizes
his condition and what he has missed in life.”</p>

<p>“But the chances are that the audience will throw
things at him when he appears as a comedian.”</p>

<p>“Instead of that, I believe he will convulse them with
laughter.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have some queer ideas. We’ll see who’s
right.”</p>

<p>Frank kept track of Burns, dealing out but little money
to him, and that in small portions, so that the old actor
could not buy enough liquor to get intoxicated, if he
wished to do so.</p>

<p>The first rehearsal was called on the stage of the
theater in Denver. Merry had engaged the theater for
that purpose. The entire company assembled. Frank
addressed them and told them that he was glad to see
them again. One and all, they shook hands with him.
Then Burns was called forward and introduced as the
new comedian. At this he drew himself up to his full
height, folded his arms across his breast, and said:</p>

<p>“Ay! ‘new’ is the word for it, for never before, I
swear, have I essayed a rôle so degraded or one that
hath so troubled me by night and by day. Comedy,
comedy, what sins are committed in thy name!”</p>

<p>Granville Garland nudged Douglas Dunton in the
ribs, whispering in his ear:</p>

<p>“Behold your rival!”</p>

<p>“Methinks he intrudeth on my sacred territory,”
nodded Dunton. “But he has to do it on the stage, and
on the stage I am a villain. We shall not quarrel.”</p>

<p>Burns proved to be something of a laughing-stock for
the rest of the company.</p>

<p>“He’s a freak,” declared Billy Wynne, known as
“Props.”</p>

<p>“All of that,” agreed Lester Vance.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand why Merriwell should pick up
such a creature for us to associate with,” sniffed Agnes
Kirk. “But Merriwell is forever doing something freakish.
Just think how he carried around that black tramp
cat that came onto the stage to hoodoo us the first time
we rehearsed this piece.”</p>

<p>“And there is the cat now!” exclaimed Vance, as the
same black cat came walking serenely onto the stage.</p>

<p>“Yes, here is the cat,” said Frank, who overheard the
exclamation. “She was called a hoodoo before. I have
determined that she shall be a mascot, and it is pretty
hard to get me to give anything up when I am determined
upon it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t a word to say!” declared Agnes Kirk,
but she looked several words with her eyes.</p>

<p>The rehearsal began and progressed finely till it was
time for Burns to enter. The old actor came on, but
when he tried to say his lines the words seemed to stick
in his throat and choke him. Several times he started,
but finally he broke down and turned to Frank, appealingly,
saying, huskily:</p>

<p>“I can’t! I can’t! It is a mockery and an insult to the
dead Bard of Avon! It’s no use! I give it up. I need
the money, but I cannot insult the memory of William
Shakespeare by making a burlesque of his immortal
works!”</p>

<p>Then he staggered off the stage.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink10'>CHAPTER X.—AT THE FOOT OF THE BED.</h2>

<p>Late that evening, after the work and rehearsing of
the day was over, Frank, Bart and Ephraim gathered in
the room of the first-mentioned and discussed matters.</p>

<p>“I told you Burns was no good,” said Hodge, triumphantly,
“I knew how it would be, but he showed up
sooner than I expected. I suppose you will get rid of
him in a hurry now?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” answered Merry, quietly.</p>

<p>“What?” cried Hodge, astounded. “You don’t mean
to say you will keep him after what has happened?”</p>

<p>“I may.”</p>

<p>“Well, Frank, I’m beginning to believe the theatrical
business has turned your head. You do not seem to
possess the good sense you had once.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” laughed Merry.</p>

<p>“Just so!” snapped Hodge.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know! I rather think Burns will turn
out all right.”</p>

<p>“After making such a fizzle to-day? Well, you’re
daffy!”</p>

<p>“You do not seem to understand the man at all. I
can appreciate his feelings.”</p>

<p>“I can’t!”</p>

<p>“I thought not. It must be rather hard for him, who
has always considered himself a tragedian and a
Shakespeare scholar, to burlesque the parts he has studied and
loved.”</p>

<p>“Bah! That’s nonsense! Why, the man’s a pitiful
old drunkard! You give him credit for too fine feelings.”</p>

<p>“And you do not seem to give him credit for any feelings.
Even a drunkard may have fine feelings at times.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so! I know it. It is drink that degrades
and lowers the man. When he is sober, he may be kind,
gentle and lovable.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t much patience with a man who will
keep himself filled with whisky.”</p>

<p>Frank opened his lips to say something, but quickly
changed his mind, knowing he must cut Hodge deeply.
He longed, however, to say that the ones most prone to
err and fall in this life are often the harshest judges
of others who go astray.</p>

<p>“I ruther pity the pore critter,” said Ephraim; “but
I don’t b’lieve he’ll ever make ennyboddy larf in the
world. He looks too much like a funeral.”</p>

<p>“That is the very thing that should make them laugh,
when he has his make-up on. I have seen the burlesque
tragedian overdone on the stage, so that he was nauseating;
but I believe Burns can give the character just the
right touch.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you firmly believe that, it’s no use to talk to
you, for you’ll never change your mind till you have
to,” broke out Hodge. “I have seen a sample of that
in the way you deal with your enemies. Now, there was
Leslie Lawrence——”</p>

<p>“Let him rest in peace,” said Frank. “He is gone
forever.”</p>

<p>“An’ it’s a dinged good riddance!” said Gallup. “The
only thing I’m sorry fer is that the critter escaped
lynchin’!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he should have been lynched!” flashed Bart. “At
the Twin Star Ranch now the poor girl he deserted is
lying on a bed of pain, shot down by his dastardly hand.”</p>

<p>“He did not intend the bullet for her,” said Frank,
quickly.</p>

<p>“No; but he intended it for you! It was a great case
of luck that he didn’t finish you. If you had pushed the
villain to the wall before that, instead of dealing with
him as if he had the least instinct of a gentleman in his
worthless body, you would have saved the girl from so
much suffering.”</p>

<p>“She loves him still,” said Frank. “Her last words to
me were a message to him, for she does not know he is
dead beneath the quicksands of Big Sandy.”</p>

<p>“The quicksands saved him from the gallows.”</p>

<p>“An’ they took another ungrateful rascal along with
him, b’gee!” said Ephraim, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Frank; “I think there is no doubt but
Lloyd Fowler perished with Lawrence, for I fancied I
recognized Fowler in the fellow who accompanied Lawrence
that fatal night.”</p>

<p>“And Fowler was a drinking man, so I should think
he would be a warning to you,” said Hodge. “I shouldn’t
think you’d care to take another sot into the company.”</p>

<p>“You must know that there is as little resemblance
between Fowler and Burns as there is between night and
day.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but Burns can drink more whisky than
Fowler ever could.”</p>

<p>“And he is ashamed of himself for it. I have talked
with him about it, and I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he made you believe so. He is slick.”</p>

<p>“He was not trying to deceive me.”</p>

<p>“So you think. He knows where his money comes
from to buy whisky. It’s more than even chance that,
when you are ready to start on the road, he will give you
the slip.”</p>

<p>“He asked me to release him to-day.”</p>

<p>“And you refused?”</p>

<p>“I did. I urged him to stay with us.”</p>

<p>Hodge got up.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” he exclaimed. “Now I know theatricals
have wrought your downfall! Your glory is fast
departing.”</p>

<p>“Then let it depart!” laughed Frank. “You have
been forced to confess yourself mistaken on other occasions;
you may on this.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Hodge, and he went out.</p>

<p>Ephraim grinned.</p>

<p>“Some fellows would say it’d be a gol-danged sensible
thing fer yeou to git rid of that feller,” he said, nodding
toward the door. “He’s gittin’ to be the greatest croaker
I ever knew.”</p>

<p>“Hodge is getting worse,” admitted Frank, gravely.
“I think the unfortunate end of his college course has had
much to do with it. He broods over that a great deal,
and it is making him sour and unpleasant. I can imagine
about how he feels.”</p>

<p>“If he ever larfed he’d be more agreeable. Danged if
I like a feller that alwus looks so sollum an’ ugly.
Sometimes he looks as ef he could snap a spike off at one bite
an’ not harf try.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Frank. “If I am successful with this
play, I hope to go back to Yale in the fall and take Hodge
with me. I think he is getting an idea into his head that
his life career has been ruined at the very start, and that
is making him bitter. I’ll take him back, run him into
athletics, get his mind off such unpleasant thoughts, and
make a new man of him.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I hope ye do,” said Gallup, rising and preparing
to go. “There’s jest one thing abaout Hodge that
makes me keer a rap fer him.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“It’s ther way he sticks to yeou. Be gosh! I be’lieve
he’d wade through a red-hot furnace to reach yeou an’
fight for yeou, if yeou was in danger!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a doubt but he’d make the attempt,” nodded
Frank.</p>

<p>“An’ he kin fight,” the Vermonter went on. “Aout at
Ace High, when we was up against all them ruffians, he
fought like a dozen tigers all rolled inter one. That’s
ernnther thing that makes me think a little somethin’ of
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Merry, “Bart is a good fighter. The
only trouble with him is that he is too ready to fight.
There are times when one should avoid a fight, if possible;
but Hodge never recognizes any of those times. I
never knew him to try to avoid a fight.”</p>

<p>“Waal,” drawled Ephraim, with a yawn, “I’m goin’
to bed. Good-night, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>Merry closed the door after Gallup and carefully
locked and bolted it. Then he sat down, took a letter
from his pocket, and read it through from beginning to
end. When he had finished, he pressed the missive to
his lips, murmuring:</p>

<p>“Elsie! Elsie! dear little sweetheart!”</p>

<p>For some time he sat there, thinking, thinking. His
face flushed and paled softened and glowed again; sometimes
he looked sad, and sometimes he smiled. Had a
friend been there, he might have read Frank’s thoughts
by the changing expressions on his face.</p>

<p>At last Merry put away the letter, after kissing it again,
and, having wound up his watch, undressed and prepared
for bed. His bed stood in a little alcove of the room,
and he drew the curtains back, exposing it. Donning
pajamas, he soon was in bed. Reaching out, he pressed
a button, and—snap!—out went the gas, turned off by
electricity.</p>

<p>Frank composed himself to sleep. The dull rumble
of the not yet sleeping city came up from the streets and
floated in at his open window. The sound turned after
a time to a musical note that was like that which comes
from an organ, and it lulled him to sleep.</p>

<p>For some time Merry seemed to sleep as peacefully as
a child. Gradually the roaring from the streets became
less and less. Frank breathed softly and regularly.</p>

<p>And then, without starting or stirring, he opened his
eyes. He lay quite still and listened, but heard no sound
at first. For all of this, he was impressed by a feeling
that something was there in that room with him!</p>

<p>It was a strange, creepy, chilling sensation that ran
over Frank. He shivered the least bit.</p>

<p>Rustle-rustle! It was the lightest of sounds, but he
was sure he heard it.</p>

<p>Some object was moving in the room!</p>

<p>Frank remembered that he had closed and locked the
door. Not only had he locked it, but he had bolted it,
so that it could not be opened from the outside by the aid
of a key alone.</p>

<p>What was there in that room? How had anything
gained admittance?</p>

<p>Frank attempted to convince himself that it was imagination,
but he was a youth with steady nerves, and he
knew he was not given to imagining such things without
cause.</p>

<p>Rustle—rustle!</p>

<p>There it was again! There was no doubt of it this
time!</p>

<p>Something moved near the foot of the bed!</p>

<p>Still without stirring, Merriwell turned his gaze in
that direction.</p>

<p>At the foot of the bed a dark shape seemed to tower!</p>

<p>Impressed by a sense of extreme peril, Frank shot his
hand out of the bed toward the electric button on the
wall.</p>

<p>By chance he struck the right button.</p>

<p>Snap!—up flared the gas.</p>

<p>And there at the foot of the bed stood a man in black,
his face hidden by a mask.</p>

<p>The sudden up-flaring of the gas seemed to startle
the unknown intruder and disconcert him for a moment.
With a hiss, he started backward.</p>

<p>Bolt upright sat Frank.</p>

<p>Merry’s eyes looked straight into the eyes that peered
through the twin holes in the mask.</p>

<p>Thus they gazed at each other some seconds.</p>

<p>There was no weapon in the hands of the masked man,
and Merriwell guessed that the fellow was a burglar.</p>

<p>That was Frank’s first thought.</p>

<p>Then came another.</p>

<p>Why had the man sought the bed? Frank’s clothes
were lying on some chairs outside the alcove, and in
order to go through them it had not been necessary to
come near the bed.</p>

<p>Then Merry remembered the feeling of danger that
had come over him, and something told him this man
had entered that room to do him harm. Somehow,
Frank became convinced that the fellow had been creeping
up to seize a pillow, fling himself on the bed, press
the pillow over the sleeper’s face, and commit a fearful
crime.</p>

<p>Even then Frank wondered how the man could have
gained admittance to the room.</p>

<p>Up leaped the former Yale athlete; backward sprang
the masked man. Over the foot of the bed Merry recklessly
flung himself, dodging a hand that shot out at
him, and placing himself between the man and the door.</p>

<p>As he bounded toward the door, Merriwell saw, with
a feeling of unutterable amazement, that it was tightly
closed and that the bolt was shot in place, just as he had
left it.</p>

<p>He whirled about, with his back toward the door.</p>

<p>“Good-evening!” he said. “Isn’t this rather late for
a call? I wasn’t expecting you.”</p>

<p>The man was crouching before him, as if to spring
toward him, but Frank’s cool words seemed to cause
further hesitation. A muttering growl came from behind
the mask, but no words did the unknown speak.</p>

<p>“It is possible you dropped into the wrong room,”
said Merry. “I trust you will be able to explain yourself,
for you are in a rather awkward predicament. Besides
that, you have hidden your face, and that does not
speak well for your honest intentions.”</p>

<p>Without doubt, the intruder was astonished by Merriwell’s
wonderful coolness. Although startled from
slumber in such a nerve-shocking manner, Frank now
seemed perfectly self-possessed.</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to be a very sociable sort of caller,”
said Merry, with something like a faint laugh. “Won’t
you take off your mask and sit down a while.”</p>

<p>The youth asked the question as if he were inviting
the stranger to take off his hat and make himself at home.</p>

<p>The man’s hand slipped into his bosom. Frank
fancied it sought a weapon.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Merry had no weapon at hand,
and he felt that he would be in a very unpleasant position
if that other were to “get the drop” on him.</p>

<p>Frank made a rush at the stranger.</p>

<p>The man tried to draw something from his bosom, but
it seemed to catch and hang there, and Merry was on
him. The unknown tried to dodge, and he partly succeeded
in avoiding Frank’s arms.</p>

<p>However, he did not get fully away, and, a second
later, they grappled.</p>

<p>The man, however, had the advantage; for all that
Frank had rushed upon him, he had risen partly behind
Merry, after dodging. He clutched Frank about the
waist and attempted to hurl him to the floor with crushing
force.</p>

<p>Frank Merriwell was an expert wrestler, and, although
taken thus at a disadvantage, he squirmed about and
broke his fall, simply being forced to one knee.</p>

<p>“Now I have ye!” panted the man, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Have you?” came from Frank’s lips. “Oh, I don’t
know!”</p>

<p>There was a sudden upward heaving, and the ex-Yale
athlete shot up to his feet.</p>

<p>But the man was on his back, and a hand came round
and fastened on Merry’s throat with a terrible, crushing
grip.</p>

<p>Frank realized that he was dealing with a desperate
wretch, who would not hesitate at anything. And Merriwell’s
life was the stake over which they were struggling!</p>

<p>Frank got hold of the man’s wrist and tore those
fingers from his throat, although it seemed that they
nearly tore out his windpipe in coming away.</p>

<p>On his back the fellow was panting, hoarsely, and
Merry found it no easy thing to dislodge him.</p>

<p>Round and round they whirled. Frank might have
shouted for aid, but he realized that his door was bolted
on the inside, and no assistance could reach him without
breaking it down.</p>

<p>Besides that, Merry’s pride held him in check. There
was but one intruder, and he did not feel like shouting
and thus seeming to confess himself outmatched and
frightened.</p>

<p>They were at a corner of the alcove. The partition
projected sharply there, and, of a sudden, with all his
strength, Merry flung himself backward, dashing the man
on his back against that projecting corner.</p>

<p>There was a grunt, a groan, and a curse.</p>

<p>It seemed that, for an instant, the shock had hurt and
dazed the man, and, in that instant, Merry wrenched
himself free.</p>

<p>“Now this thing will be somehow more even,” he whispered,
from his crushed and aching throat. He whirled
to grapple with the fellow, but again the slippery rascal
dodged him, leaping away.</p>

<p>Frank followed.</p>

<p>The man caught up a chair, swung it and struck at
Merriwell’s head with force enough to crush Frank’s
skull.</p>

<p>Merry could not dodge, but he caught the chair and
saved his head, although he was sent reeling backward
by the blow.</p>

<p>Had the fellow followed him swiftly then it is barely
possible he might have overcome Frank before Merry
could steady himself. A moment of hesitation, however,
was taken advantage of by the youth.</p>

<p>The chair was tossed aside, and Merry darted after
the fellow, who was astounded and dismayed by his persistence.</p>

<p>Round to the opposite side of the table darted the
intruder, and across the table they stared at each other.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, in grim confession, “you are making
a right good fight of it, and I will say that you are
very slippery. I haven’t been able to get a hold of you
yet, though. You’ll come down on the run when I do.”</p>

<p>The man was standing directly beneath the gas jet
which Merry had lighted by pressing the electric button.
Of a sudden he reached up and turned off the gas, plunging
the room in darkness. Then, as Frank sprang toward
the jet, something swooped down on him, covering
his head and shoulders in a smothering manner!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink11'>CHAPTER XI.—A MYSTERY TO SOLVE.</h2>

<p>Frank realized that some of the clothing from the bed
had been torn off and flung over his head. He attempted
to cast it aside, but it became tangled so he could not
accomplish his purpose as readily as he wished, although
he was not long in doing so.</p>

<p>Retreating, he was prepared for an assault, for it
seemed that the masked unknown would follow up the
advantage he had gained.</p>

<p>No assault came.</p>

<p>Frank paused and listened, and, to his amazement, he
could hear no sound in the room. Still, he felt that the
man must be there, awaiting for an opportunity to carry
out the deadly purpose which had brought him into his
apartment at that hour.</p>

<p>It was not pleasant to stand there in the darkness, half
expecting to feel a knife buried between his shoulders at
any instant.</p>

<p>Gradually Frank’s eyes became accustomed to the semi-gloom
of the room. Still, he could see nothing that
lived and moved. Beyond him was the window, standing
open as he had left it, the light wind gently moving
the draperies.</p>

<p>“Well,” thought Merry, “I wonder how long the fellow
will keep still. He’ll have to make a move sometime.”</p>

<p>He backed up against the door and stood there, facing
the window. Placing a hand behind him, he took hold of
the knob of the door, which he found was still locked
securely. This assured him that the intruder had not escaped
in that direction.</p>

<p>Merry felt certain that the man was close at hand. He
knew he could unlock and unbolt the door and leap out
quickly. He could slam the door behind him and lock
it, thus penning the man in there. Then he could descend
to the office and inform the clerk that he had captured
a burglar.</p>

<p>Somehow, he did not feel like doing that; that seemed
too much as if he were running away. He did not fancy
doing anything that seemed in the least cowardly, even
though it might be discreet.</p>

<p>Further than that, however, it was by no means certain
that, even though he locked and secured the door
behind him after leaping out of the room, he could hold
the intruder captive.</p>

<p>In some manner the man had entered that room without
disturbing the lock or bolt on the door.</p>

<p>How had he entered?</p>

<p>Frank looked toward the open window, but he knew
it opened upon the face of the hotel, four stories from the
level of the street, and that settled in his mind all doubts
about the window, for he instantly decided that it had
not been possible for the masked unknown to get into
the room that way.</p>

<p>Had he been in some old colonial house he would have
fancied the fellow had gained admittance by means of a
panel in the wall and a secret passage; but he was in a
modern hotel, and it was beyond the range of probability
that there were secret passages or moving wall panels in
the structure.</p>

<p>These thoughts flitted through his mind swiftly as he
stood there, trying to hear some sound that would tell
him where the intruder was in the room.</p>

<p>All was still.</p>

<p>Below in the street a cab rattled and rumbled along.</p>

<p>The silence was even more nerve-racking than the unexpected
appearance of the masked man had been. The
mystery of the whole affair was beginning to impress
Merry, and a mystery always aroused his curiosity to the
highest pitch.</p>

<p>“Take your time, sir,” he thought, as he leaned against
the door and waited. “I believe I can stand it as long
as you can.”</p>

<p>Near at hand the door of another room swiftly opened
and closed. The sound of hurried footsteps passed the
door of Merriwell’s room.</p>

<p>Frank was tempted to fling open his door and call to
the man, but he hesitated about that till it was too
late.</p>

<p>“Let him go,” he thought. “Perhaps he would have
been frightened to death had I called him in here.”</p>

<p>The push button by which he could call assistance from
the office was in the alcove. At this time of night it was
not likely there would be anything but a tardy answer
to his call should he make it.</p>

<p>But the electric button which turned on and ignited the
gas was also in the alcove.</p>

<p>Frank longed to reach that button. He longed to light
the gas in order to look around for the intruder.</p>

<p>Of course he could have lighted it with a match; but
he realized that such a thing might be just what the
unknown hoped for and expected. The man might be
waiting for him to strike a match.</p>

<p>The minutes fled.</p>

<p>“Something must be done,” Merry at last decided.</p>

<p>Then he resolved to leave the door, move slowly along
the wall, reach the button and light the gas—if possible.</p>

<p>With the silence of a creeping cat, he inched along.
Every sense was on the alert.</p>

<p>It took him a long time to come to the foot of the bed at
the opening of the alcove, but he reached it at last. Was
the masked man waiting for him in the darkness of the
alcove? It seemed certain that he could be nowhere else
in the room.</p>

<p>Frank hesitated, nerving himself for what might come.
Surely it required courage to enter that alcove.</p>

<p>He listened, wondering if he could hear the breathing
of the man crouching in the alcove.</p>

<p>He heard nothing.</p>

<p>Then every nerve and muscle seemed to grow taut in
Merriwell’s body, and, with one panther-like spring, he
landed on the bed. In the twinkling of an eye he was
at the head of the bed, and his fingers found the push
button.</p>

<p>Snap!—the gas came on, with a flare.</p>

<p>It showed him standing straight up on the bed, his
hands clinched, ready for anything that might follow.</p>

<p>Nothing followed.</p>

<p>Frank began to feel puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why in the name of everything peculiar doesn’t he
get into gear and do something—if he’s going to do
anything at all?” thought the youth on the bed.</p>

<p>Again a bound carried him over the footboard and out
into the middle of the room, where he whirled to face the
alcove, his eyes flashing round the place.</p>

<p>The bed covering which had been flung over his head
lay in the middle of the floor, where he had cast it aside.</p>

<p>Nothing stirred in the room. On a chair near at hand
Frank could hear his watch ticking in his pocket.</p>

<p>Then the intruder had not taken the watch, which was
valuable.</p>

<p>Frank glanced toward his clothes. He had carefully
placed them in a certain position when he undressed, and
there they lay, as if they had not been touched or disturbed
in the least.</p>

<p>“Queer burglar,” meditated Merry. “Should have
thought he’d gone through my clothes first thing.”</p>

<p>But where was the fellow? There seemed but one place
for him, and Frank stopped to look beneath the bed.</p>

<p>There was no one under the bed. The wardrobe door
stood slightly ajar.</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought Frank. “At last! He must be in there,
for there is no other place in this room where he could
hide.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Frank flung open the door of the
wardrobe, saying:</p>

<p>“Come out, sir!”</p>

<p>But the wardrobe was empty, save of such clothing
and things as Frank had placed there with his own
hands.</p>

<p>Merriwell fell back, beginning to feel very queer. He
looked all around the room, walking over to a sofa
across a corner and looking behind that. In the middle
of the floor he stopped.</p>

<p>“This beats anything I ever came against!” he exclaimed.
“Was it a spook?”</p>

<p>Then the pain in his throat, where those iron hands had
threatened to crush his windpipe, told him that it was no
“spook.”</p>

<p>“And it could not have been a dream,” he decided. “I
know there was a living man in this room. How did he
escape? That is one question. When it is answered,
I shall know how he obtained admittance. And why did
he come here?”</p>

<p>Frank examined his clothes to make sure that nothing
had been taken. He soon discovered that his watch,
money and such valuables as he carried about with him
every day, were there, not a thing having been disturbed.
That settled one point in Frank’s mind. The
man had not entered that room for the purpose of robbery.</p>

<p>If not for robbery, what then?</p>

<p>It must have been for the purpose of wreaking some
injury on Merriwell as he slept.</p>

<p>“I was warned by my feelings,” Frank decided. “I
was in deadly peril; there is no doubt of that.”</p>

<p>Frank went to the window and looked out. It seemed
a foolish thing to do, for he had looked out and seen
that there was not even a fire escape to aid a person in
gaining admittance to his room. The fire escape, he had
been told, was at the end of the corridor.</p>

<p>It was a night without a moon, but the electric lights
shone in the street below. Something caused Merry to
turn his head and look to his left.</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>Close against the face of the outer wall something
dangled.</p>

<p>A sudden eagerness seized him. He leaned far out of
the window, doing so at no small risk, and reached along
the wall toward the object. With the tip of his fingers
he grasped it and drew it toward him.</p>

<p>It was a rope!</p>

<p>“The mystery is solved!” muttered Frank, with satisfaction.
“This explains how the fellow entered my
room.”</p>

<p>He shook the rope and looked upward. He could see
that it ran over the sill of a window two stories above.</p>

<p>“Did he come down from there? Should have thought
he would have selected a window directly over this. And
did he climb back up this swaying, loosely dangling
rope?”</p>

<p>Frank wondered not a little. And then, as he was
leaning out of his window, the light of the street lamps
showed him that a window beyond the dangling rope, on
a level with his, was standing open.</p>

<p>The sight gave Merry a new idea.</p>

<p>“I believe I understand how the trick was worked,” he
muttered.</p>

<p>“That must explain how the fellow was able to vanish
so swiftly while my head was covered by the bedclothes.
With the aid of this rope, he swung out from his window
and into mine. He could do it easily and noiselessly.
While my head was covered, he plunged out of the window,
caught the rope, and swung back. That’s it!”</p>

<p>Frank drew his head in quickly, but he still clung to
the end of the rope. This he drew in and lay over the
sill.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he decided, “that is the way the fellow escaped.
He had the rope right here, so that he could catch it in a
moment, and, grasping it, he plunged outward through
the window. His momentum carried him right across
and into the other window. It was a reckless thing to do,
but perfectly practical.”</p>

<p>Then he remembered how he had heard, while standing
with his back against his own door, the door of an
adjoining room open and close, followed by the sound
of swift footsteps passing outside.</p>

<p>“That was when he left his room,” Merry decided.</p>

<p>It did not take Frank long to resolve to explore that
room—to seek for some clew to the identity of the masked
intruder.</p>

<p>With the aid of the rope, he could swing into the open
window; with its aid he could swing back to his own
room.</p>

<p>He would do it.</p>

<p>Of course, Merry realized what a rash thing he was
about to do. Of course he understood that he might be
rushing to the waiting arms of his late antagonist.</p>

<p>Still he was not deterred. All his curiosity was
aroused, and he was bent on discovering the identity of
the man, if such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>He grasped the rope and climbed upon the window sill.
Looking out, he carefully calculated the distance to the
next window and the momentum he would require to take
him there. Having decided this, he prepared to make the
swing.</p>

<p>And then, just at the very instant that he swung off
from the window sill, he heard a hoarse, triumphant
laugh above.</p>

<p>He looked up.</p>

<p>Out of the window from which ran the rope, a man
was leaning. In his hand was something on which the
light from the street lamps glinted.</p>

<p>It was a knife!</p>

<p>With that knife the wretch, whose face was covered
by a mask, gave a slash at the rope, just as Merry swung
off from the sill.</p>

<p>With a twang, the rope parted!</p>

<p>It was sixty feet to the street below.</p>

<p>Frank fell.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink12'>CHAPTER XII.—THE NAME ON THE REGISTER.</h2>

<p>Not far, however, for he released the rope and shot
out his arms. He had swung across so that he was opposite
the open window when the rope was cut.</p>

<p>Merriwell knew all his peril at the instant when he
swung from the sill of his own window, but it was too
late for him to keep himself from being carried out by
the rope.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, his one thought was to reach the other
window quickly, knowing he would be dashed to death on
the paving below if he did not. He flung himself toward
that window, just as the rope parted. His arms shot in
over the sill, and there he dangled.</p>

<p>Down past his head shot the rope, twisting and writhing
in the air, like a snake. He heard it strike on the
sidewalk in front of the hotel.</p>

<p>An exclamation of rage broke from the lips of the
man in the window above, for he realized that Frank had
not fallen with the rope.</p>

<p>He leaned far out, lifted his arm, made a quick motion,
and something went gleaming and darting through
the air.</p>

<p>He had flung the knife at Frank.</p>

<p>It missed Merriwell, shot downward, and struck with
a ringing clang on the stones below.</p>

<p>“Missed!” snarled the man. “Well, I’ll get you yet!”</p>

<p>Then Merriwell drew himself in at the window, and
the peril was past.</p>

<p>No wonder he felt weak and limp. No wonder that
he was jarred and somewhat bewildered. It was a
marvel that he was not lying dead in the street below.</p>

<p>Frank understood the full extent of the peril through
which he had passed, and a prayer welled from his lips.</p>

<p>“Thank God!”</p>

<p>He was grateful in his heart, and he felt that he had
been spared through the kindness of an all-wise Providence.</p>

<p>It was some moments before he could stir. He lay on
the floor, panting, and regaining his strength.</p>

<p>He heard no sound in the room, for all the noise he
had made in coming in, and more than ever he became
convinced that the room had been occupied by his desperate
enemy who had sought to destroy him that night.</p>

<p>There was now no longer a doubt concerning the purpose
of the man who had gained admission to Frank’s
room. The fellow had not come there for plunder, but for
the purpose of harming Merriwell.</p>

<p>Frank rose and sought the gas jet, which he lighted.
Then he looked around.</p>

<p>Somehow, it seemed that the room had been occupied
that night, although the bed was undisturbed, showing
that no person had slept in it.</p>

<p>Frank fancied that his enemy had sat by the window,
waiting, waiting till he felt sure Merry was sound asleep.</p>

<p>And Frank had been sleeping soundly. He realized
that, and he knew something had caused him to awaken,
just in time.</p>

<p>What was it? Was it some good spirit that hovered
near to protect him?</p>

<p>He looked all round the room, but could find nothing
that served as a clew to the identity of the man who had
occupied the apartment.</p>

<p>But the register would tell to whom the room had
been let.</p>

<p>Having decided to go down and look the register over,
Frank wondered how he was to get back into his own
room, for the door was locked and bolted on the inside.</p>

<p>He went to the window and looked out. There was
no way for him to reach his window now that the rope
had been cut.</p>

<p>“And I should not be surprised if I am locked in this
room,” thought Merry.</p>

<p>Investigation showed, however, that the door was unlocked,
and he was able to step out into the corridor.</p>

<p>But there he was, shut out from his own room by lock
and bolt, and dressed in nothing but a suit of pajamas.</p>

<p>The adventure had assumed a ludicrous aspect. Frank
wondered what he could do. It was certain that they
would not break into his room at that hour of the night,
for the sound of bursting the bolt would disturb other
sleepers.</p>

<p>The watchman came down the corridor. He saw
Frank and came onward with haste, plainly wondering
what Merry was doing there.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Frank, “I want to know the name
of the man who occupies No. 231, this room next to
mine.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the watchman.</p>

<p>“This person has disturbed me,” said Frank, truthfully.
“I am not going to raise a kick about it to-night,
but I shall report it to the clerk in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Does he snore loudly?” inquired the watchman. “I
didn’t think you could hear through those partitions.”</p>

<p>“Here,” said Frank, who had seen the watchman before,
“you know me. My name is Merriwell. I haven’t
a cent in these pajamas, but I’ll give you two dollars in
the morning if you will go down to the office, look on the
register, find out who occupies No. 231, and come back
here and tell me.”</p>

<p>Now it happened that Frank had given the watchman
fifty cents the night before to do something for him, and
so the man was persuaded to go down to the office, although
it is quite probable that he did not expect to see
the promised two dollars in the morning.</p>

<p>Frank waited.</p>

<p>The watchman came back after a time.</p>

<p>“Well,” asked Merry, “did you look on the register and
find out the name of the man who was given No. 231?”</p>

<p>“I did,” nodded the watchman.</p>

<p>“What is his name?”</p>

<p>“William Shakespeare Burns,” was the astonishing
answer.</p>

<p>Frank staggered. He told the watchman he had made
a mistake, but the man insisted that he had not. That
was enough to excite Merry more than anything that had
happened to date.</p>

<p>Could it be that Burns, the old actor, whom he had
befriended, had sought his life?</p>

<p>It did not seem possible.</p>

<p>If it were true, then, beyond a doubt, the man had been
bribed to do the deed by some person who remained in
the background.</p>

<p>It did not take Frank long to tell the watchman what
had happened. The man could scarcely believe it. He
seemed to regard Merriwell as somewhat deranged.</p>

<p>“If you do not think I am telling the truth,” said
Merry, “get your keys and try my door. If you are able
to open it, I shall be greatly pleased.”</p>

<p>The watchman did so, but he could not open the door
of the room.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Merry, “to make yourself doubly sure,
go down to the sidewalk in front of the hotel and you
will find the rope there.”</p>

<p>The man went down and found the rope. He came
back greatly agitated.</p>

<p>“This is a most astonishing occurrence,” he said.
“Never knew anything like it to happen here before.”</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open for the man who had No. 231,”
said Merry. “I am going to take that room and sleep
there the rest of the night. In the morning the door of
my room must be opened for me.”</p>

<p>He went into that room, closed the door, locked it and
bolted it, closed and fastened the window, and went to
bed. Of course he did not go to sleep right away, but he
forced himself to do so, after a time, and he slept peacefully
till morning.</p>

<p>In the morning Frank found the door of his room had
been forced, so he was able to go in immediately on
rising. He had been unable to obtain a room with a
private bath connected, but there was a bathroom directly
across the corridor, and he took his morning “dip,”
coming out as bright as a new dollar.</p>

<p>But the mystery of the midnight intruder weighed
heavily on Merry. He felt that he would give anything
to solve it, and it must be solved in some manner.</p>

<p>Bart came around before breakfast, and he found Merriwell
standing in the middle of his room, scowling at
the carpet. Frank was so unlike his accustomed self that
Hodge was astounded.</p>

<p>“What’s happened?” asked Bart.</p>

<p>“One of the most singular adventures of my life,” answered
Frank, and he proceeded to tell Bart everything.</p>

<p>“Singular!” cried Hodge. “I should say so! You
are dead in luck to be alive!”</p>

<p>“I consider myself so,” confessed Merry; “but I would
give any sum to know who entered my room last night.
Of course the name on the register was false.”</p>

<p>“Are you certain?”</p>

<p>“Certain! Great Scott! You do not fancy for an instant
that Burns was the man, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do!”</p>

<p>“You mean you think you do.”</p>

<p>“No; I mean that I know. Burns was not the man.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Why, hang it, Hodge! Why should that unfortunate
old fellow wish to harm me, who has been his friend?”</p>

<p>“Somebody may have hired him to do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re daffy on that point! Reason will teach
you that. If it had been Burns, he would not have registered
under his own name. But I absolutely know it was
not Burns I encountered. Besides being ridiculous that
a man of his years and habits should venture to enter my
room in such a manner, the man whom I encountered
was supple, strong, and quick as a flash. Burns could
not have fought like that; he could not have escaped in
such an astonishing manner.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, perhaps not,” admitted Hodge, who seemed
reluctant to give up. “But I have warned you against
Burns all along, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, drop him now! Somebody else is trying to injure
the poor fellow. I want to know who did the job last
night, and W. S. Burns will not be able to tell me anything.”</p>

<p>Bart had no more to say, and they went down to breakfast
together.</p>

<p>Of course the hotel people promised to do everything
possible to discover who had made the assault, but Frank
had little confidence in their ability to accomplish anything.
In fact, he believed the time had passed to do
anything, for it seemed that his enemy had escaped from
the hotel without leaving a trace behind him.</p>

<p>Frank thought over the list of enemies who had sought
to injure him since he entered theatricals, and he was
startled. Three of his enemies were dead. Arthur
Sargent had been drowned; Percy Lockwell was lynched,
and Leslie Lawrence met his death in the quicksands of
Big Sandy River. Of his living enemies, who might be
desperate enough to enter his room and seek to harm
him Philip Scudder stood alone.</p>

<p>Where was Scudder? Was he in Denver? If so——</p>

<p>“If so, he is the man!” decided Frank.</p>

<p>Merry resolved to be on his guard, for something told
him another attempt would be made against him.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink13'>CHAPTER XIII.—THE RACE.</h2>

<p>All that forenoon he worked in the theater setting up
the new mechanical arrangement, which had been completed,
and preparing for the rehearsal that afternoon.</p>

<p>Rehearsal time came, and the members of the company
assembled.</p>

<p>All but Burns.</p>

<p>He was missing.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it now?” asked Bart, grimly.</p>

<p>“The same as I thought before,” declared Frank.
“Burns was almost broken-hearted at rehearsal yesterday.
It is possible he may not come to-day, for you know he
wished to be released.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said a sad voice, as the person in question appeared;
“it is necessity that brings me. I fain would
have remained away, but I need the money, and I must
do that which my heart revolts against.”</p>

<p>“I believed you would come,” said Frank, greeting the
old tragedian. “You will get used to the part after
a while. It is better to make people laugh than to make
them weep.”</p>

<p>“But it is too late for me to turn myself into a clown.”</p>

<p>“Where did you stay last night?” asked Merry.</p>

<p>“At my humble lodgings,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“A man by your name registered at the hotel where
I stop, and had the room next to mine. Is it possible
there are two William Shakespeare Burns in the city of
Denver?”</p>

<p>The old man drew himself up, thrusting his hand into
the bosom of his coat, with his familiar movement of
dignity.</p>

<p>“There is but one,” he said—“but one real William
Shakespeare Burns in the whole world! I am he!”</p>

<p>“But you were not at the hotel last night?”</p>

<p>“Of a certainty I was not. To that I will pledge mine
honor. If another was there under my name, he is an impostor.”</p>

<p>Frank was satisfied, but Bart was not; or, if Hodge
was satisfied, he would not confess it.</p>

<p>The rehearsal began. Frank had engaged some people
to work the mechanical arrangement used in the third act,
and they had been drilled and instructed by Havener.</p>

<p>The first act went off well, the storm at the conclusion
being worked up in first-class style. Scarcely a word of
that act had Frank altered, so there was very little trouble
over it.</p>

<p>The second act was likewise a success, Havener finding
it necessary to interrupt and give instructions but twice.</p>

<p>Then came the third act, which Merry had almost entirely
rewritten. In that act the burlesque tragedian was
given an opportunity, and Burns showed that he had his
lines very well, although he ran over them after the
style of the old-time professional who disdains to do
much more than repeat the words till the dress rehearsal
comes.</p>

<p>The third act was divided into three scenes, the second
scene being an exterior, showing the river in the distance,
lined by a moving, swaying mass of people. Along the
river raced the three boats representing Yale, Harvard
and Cornell. Keeping pace with them on the shore was
the observation train, black with a mass of spectators. As
the boats first came on, Harvard had a slight lead, but
Yale spurted on appearing, and when they passed from
view Yale was leading slightly.</p>

<p>All this was a mechanical arrangement made to represent
boats, a train, the river, and the great crowd of
spectators. The rowers in the boats were inanimate objects,
but they worked with such skill that it was hard to
believe they were not living and breathing human beings.
Even the different strokes of the three crews had been
imitated.</p>

<p>This arrangement was an invention of Merriwell’s
own. In fact, it was more of an optical illusion than anything
else, but it was most remarkable in its results, for,
from the front of the house, a perfect representation of
the college boat race appeared to be taking place in the
distance on the stage.</p>

<p>Havener was a man who said very little, but he showed
excitement and enthusiasm as this scene was being
worked out.</p>

<p>When the boats had disappeared, the stage grew dark,
and there was a quick “shift” to the interior of the Yale
boathouse. The entire front of the house, toward the
river, had been flung wide open. Behind the scenes the
actors who were not on the stage at the moment and the
supers hurrahed much like the cheering of a vast multitude.
Whistles shrieked, and then the three boats shot
into view, with Yale still in the lead. The characters on
the stage proper, in the boathouse, had made it known
that the finish was directly opposite the boathouse, and
so, when the boats flew across with Yale in advance, it
was settled that the blue had won.</p>

<p>Then Frank Merriwell, who had escaped from scheming
enemies, and rowed in the race for all the attempts to
drug him, was brought on by his admirers, and with
the Yale cheer of victory, the curtain came down.</p>

<p>Roscoe Havener came rushing onto the stage and
caught Frank Merriwell by the hand, crying:</p>

<p>“Merriwell, you are a genius! I want to say right
here that I have doubted the practicability of this invention
of yours, but now I confess that it is the greatest
thing I ever saw. Your sawmill invention in ‘John
Smith’ was great, but this lays way over it! You should
make your fortune with this, but you must protect it.”</p>

<p>“I shall apply for a patent on the mechanism,” said
Frank. “I am having a working model made for that
purpose.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. You have your chance to make a fortune,
and I believe you can make it with this piece.”</p>

<p>“It is a chance,” agreed Frank, gravely; “but I shall
take it for better or worse. I am going into this thing
to make or break. I’ve got some money, and I’ll sink
every dollar I’m worth in the attempt to float this piece.”</p>

<p>Frank spoke with quiet determination.</p>

<p>Hodge stood near and nodded his approval and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“It’s great, Merry,” he said, in approval. “It’s something
new, too. You will not have any trouble over this,
the way you did about the sawmill scene.”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>Cassie Lee, the little soubrette, who was engaged to
Havener, found an opportunity to get hold of Frank’s
hand. She gave it a warm pressure.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad!” she whispered, looking into his eyes.
“If Ross says it will go, you can bet it will! He knows
his business. I’ve been waiting for him to express himself
about it, and, now that he has, I feel better. You
are right in it, Frank! I think you are a dandy!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Cassie,” smiled Frank, looking down at
her.</p>

<p>And even though he liked Cassie, who had always been
his friend, he was thinking at that moment of another
little girl who was far away, but whom he had once hoped
would create the part in “True Blue” that had been given
to Cassie.</p>

<p>In the fourth act Frank had skillfully handled the
“fall” of the play, keeping all in suspense as he worked
out the problem, one of the chief arts of successful
play constructing. Too often a play falls to pieces at
once after the grand climax is reached, and the final act
is obviously tacked on to lengthen it out.</p>

<p>This one fault Frank had worked hard to avoid, and
he had succeeded with masterly skill, even introducing a
new element of suspense into the final act.</p>

<p>Merry had noticed that, in these modern days, the
audience sniffs the “and-lived-happy-forever-after” conclusion
of a play from afar, and there was always a
rustling to get hats and coats and cloaks some moments
before the end of most plays. To avoid this, he determined
to end his play suddenly and in an original manner.
This he succeeded in doing in a comedy scene, but
not until the last speech was delivered was the suspense
entirely relieved.</p>

<p>Havener, who could not write a play to save his life,
but who understood thoroughly the construction of a
piece, and was a discriminating critic, was nearly as well
pleased by the end of the piece as by the mechanical
effect in the third act.</p>

<p>“If this play does not make a big hit I shall call myself
a chump,” he declared. “I was afraid of it in its
original form, but the changes have added to it the elements
it needed to become immensely popular.”</p>

<p>When the rehearsal was over Cassie Lee found Burns
seated on a property stump behind the scenes, his face
bowed on his hands, his attitude that of one in deep
sorrow.</p>

<p>“Now, what’s the matter with you?” she asked, not
unkindly. “Are you sick?”</p>

<p>The old tragedian raised his sad face and spoke:</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      “‘Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      To make my end too sudden; learn good soul,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      To think our former state a happy dream;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      From which awaked, the truth of what we are<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      Shews to us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      To grim necessity; and he and I<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      Will keep a league till death.’”<br/>
</p>

<p>There was something strangely impressive in the old
man’s words and manner, and the laugh she tried to
force died on Cassie’s lips.</p>

<p>“I s’pose that’s Shakespeare you are giving me,” she
said. “I don’t go much on Shake. He was all right in
his day, but his day is past, and he won’t go down with
people in general now. The public wants something up
to date, like this new play of Merriwell’s, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” sighed Burns; “I think you speak the truth.
In these degenerate days the vulgar rabble must be fed
with what it can understand. The rabble’s meager intellects
do not fathom the depths of the immortal poet’s
thoughts, but its eyes can behold a mechanical arrangement
that represents a boat race, and I doubt not that
the groundlings will whoop themselves hoarse over it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” nodded Cassie. “That’s what we
want, for I rather reckon Mr. Merriwell is out for the
dust.”</p>

<p>“The dust! Ah, sordid mortals! All the world, to-day,
seems ‘out for the dust.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I rather think that’s right. What do you want,
anyway? If you have plenty to eat and drink and wear
you’re in luck.”</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;                                    “‘What is a man<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    If his chief good and market of his time<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.’”<br/>
</p>

<p>“That’s all right; but just think of the ones who can’t
get all they want to eat, and who are driven to work like
dogs, day after day, without ever getting enough sleep
to rest them.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but few of them have hopes or aspirations. They
are worms of the earth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know! I reckon some of them are as
good as anybody, but they’re down on their luck. The
world has gone against them.”</p>

<p>“But they have never climbed to the heights, only to
slip back to the depths. Then is when the world turns
dark.”</p>

<p>The old tragedian bowed his head again, and, feeling
that she could say nothing to cheer him up, Cassie left
him there.</p>

<p>Frank came in later, and had a talk with Burns. The
old man acknowledged that he believed the play would
be a success, but he bemoaned his fate to be forced to
play a part so repulsive to him. Merry assured him that
he would get over that in time, and succeeded in putting
some spirit into the old fellow.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink14'>CHAPTER XIV.—FRANK’S NEW COMEDIAN.</h2>

<p>The day came for the great dress rehearsal of “True
Blue,” to which the theatrical people of Denver, the
newspaper men, and a great number of prominent people
had been invited.</p>

<p>Frank had determined on this course at great expense,
but he believed he would be repaid for the outlay.</p>

<p>His chief object was to secure good newspaper notices
and recommendations from the theater managers in the
city.</p>

<p>It was to be an afternoon performance, so that it
would not interfere with any of the regular theatrical
attractions to play in town that night.</p>

<p>Early in the day Hodge advised Frank to keep a sharp
watch on Burns.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him have any money, Merry. He fancies
he will have to go through a terrible ordeal this afternoon,
and he wishes to brace up for it. If he gets all
he wants to drink, he will be loaded to the muzzle when
the time comes to play.”</p>

<p>Frank feared this, and so, when Burns appealed to
him for money, he refused the old man, telling him he
could have some after the performance.</p>

<p>Then Merry set Gallup to watch the tragedian.</p>

<p>Frank was at work in the theater, where various
members of the company were practicing specialties, and
the stage hands were arranging everything so that there
would be no hitch about the performance.</p>

<p>Within thirty minutes after Gallup was set to watch
the old actor, he came to Frank in a hurry, saying:</p>

<p>“If you want to keep Mr. Burns sober, I advise yeou
to come with me an’ git him aout of a grog shop daown
the street, Merry.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Frank. “Why, he hasn’t
the money to buy liquor, even if he has gone into a
saloon.”</p>

<p>“He won’t hev to buy it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, I saw two men pick him up an’ take him inter
the gin mill. They axed him would he come in an’ have
somethin’ with them.”</p>

<p>“Did he know them?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t seem ter. He looked kainder s’prised, but he
accepted the invite in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Then it is time that we looked after him,” nodded
Merry, grimly. “Show me where he has gone, Ephraim.”</p>

<p>Hodge followed them. They left the theater and hurried
along the street to a saloon.</p>

<p>“He went in here,” said Ephraim.</p>

<p>Without a word, Frank entered.</p>

<p>The moment Merry was within the place he saw Burns
standing near the bar, while a crowd had gathered around
him. The old man had placed his hat on the bar, tossed
back his long, black hair, which was streaked with gray,
struck a pose, and was just beginning to declaim from
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>“Go it, old chap!” cried a half-intoxicated man. “We’ll
put up the red eye for you as long as you will spout.”</p>

<p>The old man’s voice rang out clear and strong. His
pronunciation was perfect, and his enunciation clear and
distinct. Involuntarily Merry paused a moment to listen.
At that moment it came to Frank that Burns might, beyond
a doubt, have been an actor of no small merit had he
eschewed drink and followed his ambition with unswerving
purpose. For the first time Merry fully appreciated
the outraged feelings of the old fellow who was compelled
to burlesque the tragedian on the stage.</p>

<p>Frank strode forward into the crowd, followed by his
friends.</p>

<p>“Burns,” he said, quietly, interrupting the old man, “I
want you to come with me.”</p>

<p>The aged actor stopped speaking, all the dignity seemed
to melt from him in a moment, and he reached for his hat,
murmuring:</p>

<p>“I merely came in for one small bracer. I needed it,
and the gentlemen were good enough to invite me.”</p>

<p>“Here!” coarsely cried a man. “What’s this mean?
Who’s this that’s comin’ here to spoil our fun?”</p>

<p>“Throw the feller out!” cried another.</p>

<p>Growls of anger came from the others gathered about,
and they crowded nearer.</p>

<p>“Look out for trouble!” whispered Hodge, in Frank’s
ear.</p>

<p>“Get out of here,” ordered the first speaker, confronting
Merry. “We’re bein’ entertained.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—gentlemen,” said Merry, smoothly,
hesitating slightly before the final word. “There are
reasons why I come here to take Mr. Burns with me. I
am sorry to spoil your entertainment, but it is necessary.”</p>

<p>“Is the old fellow bound out to you?” sneeringly, asked
one. “Do you own him?”</p>

<p>“No man owns me!” cried the tragedian, drawing himself
up and staring round. “I am my own master.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you don’t dare take another drink,” said the
man, quickly thrusting a brimming glass of whisky toward
Burns. “You’re afraid of the young gent.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of nobody,” declared Burns, eagerly reaching
for the glass. “I have drunk all I could get, and I always
shall, for all of anybody.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!”</p>

<p>“Down with it!”</p>

<p>“Take your medicine!”</p>

<p>“You’re the boy!”</p>

<p>The crowd shouted its approval.</p>

<p>Burns lifted the glass.</p>

<p>Frank’s hand fell gently on his arm.</p>

<p>“Mr. Burns,” he said, swiftly, “I ask you as a particular
favor not to drink that liquor. I ask you as a gentleman
not to do it.”</p>

<p>Merry knew how to appeal to the old man in a manner
that would touch the right spot. Burns looked straight
into Frank’s eyes an instant, and then he placed the glass
on the bar.</p>

<p>“If you ask me that way,” he said, “ten thousand
fiends cannot force me to touch the stuff!”</p>

<p>There was a groan from the crowd.</p>

<p>“The old duffer caves!” sneered one man. “He hasn’t
any backbone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say!” sibilated Hodge, in Merry’s ear; “get him
out of here in a hurry! I can’t stand much of this! I
feel like thumping a few of these ruffians.”</p>

<p>“Steady!” cautioned Frank. “We do not want to get
into a barroom brawl if we can avoid it.”</p>

<p>“They’re a purty darn tough-lookin’ craowd,” muttered
Ephraim.</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t it be a purty good thing fer ther young
chaps all ter take a drink?” suggested somebody.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” cried the leader. “I’ll stand for them
all, and the actor shall drink with them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let them git out, gents, till they’ve taken their
bitters.”</p>

<p>The rough men hemmed them in.</p>

<p>“I fear you are in an unfortunate predicament,” said
Burns. “You will have to drink with them.”</p>

<p>“I never drink,” said Merry, quietly.</p>

<p>“Yer can’t refuse here,” declared the man who had
offered to buy the drinks. “It’s a mortal insult ter refuse
ter drink hyar.”</p>

<p>“I never took a drink in my life, gentlemen,” said
Merriwell, speaking calmly, and distinctly, “and I shall
not begin now. You will have to excuse me.”</p>

<p>He started to force his way through the crowd. A hand
reached out to clutch him, and he wheeled like a flash toward
the man, at whom he pointed squarely, crying:</p>

<p>“Take off that false beard! If you are a man, show
your face! You are in disguise! I believe you are a
criminal who does not dare show his face!”</p>

<p>His ringing words drew the attention of the crowd to
the man whom he accused.</p>

<p>Merry improved the opportunity and hurried his friends
and Burns toward the door. Before the gang was aware
of it, they were out of the saloon, and Frank breathed his
relief.</p>

<p>Not till they had reached the theater did a thought come
to Frank that made him regret his hasty departure from
the saloon.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” he exclaimed. “I believe the man who
wore the false beard was the same one who entered my
room at the hotel by means of the rope!”</p>

<p>He dashed back to the saloon, followed by Hodge and
Gallup; but when he reached the place nearly all the
crowd had left, the man he sought having departed with
the others.</p>

<p>Frank was disappointed. He learned at the saloon that
the accused man had not removed the beard, but had
sneaked out in a hurry after Frank was gone.</p>

<p>Returning to the theater, Merry was informed that
Burns was behaving strangely.</p>

<p>“He seems to be doped,” declared Hodge. “I think he
has been drugged.”</p>

<p>Burns was in a dressing room, and Havener was working
to keep the man awake, although the old actor was
begging to be allowed to sleep.</p>

<p>As soon as Frank saw him he dispatched one of the supers
for a physician.</p>

<p>The doctor came and gave Burns a powerful emetic,
following that with a dose of medicine that seemed to
brace the man up. Thus Burns was pulled into shape for
the afternoon performance, although Frank realized that
he had very nearly wrecked everything.</p>

<p>Burns remained in the theater, and lunch was brought
him there.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell,” he said, “I will surprise you by the
manner in which I’ll play my part this afternoon. It shall
be burlesque of a kind that’ll satisfy you.”</p>

<p>The performance was to begin at two o’clock. Some
time before that people began to arrive, and they came fast.
At two o’clock there were nearly five hundred persons in
the auditorium.</p>

<p>The company was all made up and waiting behind the
scenes.</p>

<p>Cassie Lee started to find Frank to ask him how he
liked her make-up. In a corner behind the scenes she
saw a man stopping near a mass of piled-up scenery.
Something about the man’s appearance and his actions
attracted her attention. She saw him pick up a can and
pour some of the contents on the scenery. Then he
crouched down there, taking a match safe from his pocket.</p>

<p>In a moment it dawned on Cassie that the fellow was
up to deviltry. He had saturated the scenery with oil,
and he was about to set it on fire!</p>

<p>Cassie screamed, and Frank Merriwell, who was near
at hand, heard her. He came bounding to the spot, just
as the startled man lighted his match.</p>

<p>“Quick, Frank!” cried Cassie. “He’s setting the scenery
afire!”</p>

<p>Frank saw the fellow and leaped at him. The scenery
flared up where the match had touched it. Then the fire
bug turned to run.</p>

<p>Merriwell was on him, had him, hurled him down.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t, you dog!” grated Frank. “You shall
pay for this dastardly trick!”</p>

<p>Cassie, with rare presence of mind, caught up a rug,
which happened to be near, and beat out the fire before it
had gained much headway.</p>

<p>A terrible struggle was going on between Frank and
the man he had captured. The fellow was fighting with
all his strength to hurry off and escape.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” came through Merriwell’s teeth. “I
know you! You are the chap who entered my room!
You it was who attempted to drug Burns so that this performance
would be ruined! And now you have made a
fatal mistake by attempting to fire the theater. I have
you, and I shall hold you. You will be safely lodged behind
prison bars for this trick.”</p>

<p>“Curse you!” panted the man.</p>

<p>“That does not hurt me,” said Merry. “Now, be quiet.”</p>

<p>He pinned the fellow to the floor and held him till others
came up. Then the man’s hands were tied.</p>

<p>“Now, we’ll have a look at him,” said Merry, rolling the
captive over on his back and pulling the old hat from his
head.</p>

<p>Then he gave a cry of amazement, staggering back.</p>

<p>Hodge was there, and he was no less astounded.</p>

<p>Gallup was speechless with astonishment and incredulity.</p>

<p>“The dead alive!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>The man he had captured was the one he believed beneath
the quicksands of Big Sandy River, Leslie Lawrence!</p>

<p>“I’m not dead yet!” grated Lawrence. “Fowler went
down in the quicksands, but I managed to float away. I
hid under the river’s bank, and there I stayed, like a
hunted wolf, till you gave up looking for me. I swore to
settle the score with you, but——”</p>

<p>“You tried hard enough. You were the one who entered
my room at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Was I? Prove it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to. The job you tried to do here is
enough. That will put you safely away. Somebody call
an officer.”</p>

<p>An officer was called, and Lawrence was taken away.</p>

<p>The audience in front had heard some of the commotion
behind the scenes and had grown rather restless, but
they were soon calmed. An orchestra was on hand to
play, and everything was carried out as if it had been a
regular performance.</p>

<p>The first act went off well, and it received mild applause.
The second act seemed to take full better, but still, the audience
had not been aroused to any great show of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Then came the third act. The first surprise was Burns.
He literally convulsed the audience by the manner in
which he burlesqued the Shakespearian tragedian. He astonished
Frank, for Merry had not dreamed the old actor
could be so intensely funny. Even Hodge was seen to
smile once!</p>

<p>When Burns came off after doing an exceptionally
clever piece of work, which caused the audience to applaud
most heartily, Frank met him and grasped his hand,
saying:</p>

<p>“My dear Mr. Burns, you have made the comedy hit of
the piece! Your salary shall be fifty dollars a week, instead
of forty.”</p>

<p>But William Shakespeare Burns burst into tears, sobbing
brokenly:</p>

<p>“The comedy hit of the piece! And I have broken my
own heart!”</p>

<p>It was impossible to cheer him up.</p>

<p>The boat race followed swiftly, and it wrought the audience
up to a high pitch of enthusiasm and excitement.
When the curtain came down, there was a perfect shout
of applause, such as an enthusiastic Western audience
alone can give.</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell! Frank Merriwell!” was the cry
that went up from all parts of the house.</p>

<p>Frank was obliged to come before the curtain and make
a speech, which he did gracefully and modestly. When
he was behind the curtain again, Havener had him by the
hand, saying:</p>

<p>“You will get some rousing press notices to-morrow,
Merriwell! This play will be the hit of your life!”</p>

<p>A manager of one of the local theaters came behind
the scenes and offered Frank three thousand dollars for
the piece. When Frank declined, the man promptly made
it five thousand, but even that sum was not accepted.</p>

<p>Then came the fourth act, in which Burns again appeared
as the burlesque tragedian. In this he was to repeat
a parody on <i>Hamlet’s</i> soliloquy, but, apparently, before
he was aware of it, he began to give the soliloquy
itself.</p>

<p>In a moment the man had flung off the air of the clown.
He straightened to his full height, his eyes gleamed
with a strange fire, his chest heaved, and his voice sounded
clear as the ring of steel. He electrified every person who
heard him. With all the dramatic fire of a Booth, he
swung into the soliloquy, and a hush fell over the audience.
He held them spellbound, he swayed them at his
will, he thrilled them as never had they been thrilled. At
that moment William Shakespeare Burns was the tragedian
sublime, and it is probable that he reached such
heights as he had never before attained.</p>

<p>He finished. It was over, and then, realizing what he
had done, he tottered off the stage.</p>

<p>Then the audience applauded long and loud, trying to
call him back again; but behind the scenes he had fallen
into Frank Merriwell’s arms, faintly murmuring:</p>

<p>“It is finished!”</p>

<p>Frank bore the man to a dressing room. The play went
on to the end without a break, but it was not necessary for
Burns to enter again.</p>

<p>When the curtain fell on the final act, Havener came
hurrying to Merry:</p>

<p>“Burns wants to see you in the dressing room,” he
said. “You had better come at once.”</p>

<p>Frank went there. The moment he saw the old actor,
who was reclining on some rugs, his face ashen, his eyes
looking dim and sunken still deeper into his head, Frank
said:</p>

<p>“Somebody go for a doctor at once!”</p>

<p>He knelt beside the man, and the old actor murmured:</p>

<p>“It is useless to go for a doctor. I heard you tell them,
but it is—no use. I told you—my heart—was broken. I
spoke the—truth. It broke my heart when I—had to—burlesque——”</p>

<p>His words died out in his throat.</p>

<p>“He’s going!” somebody whispered, for the company
was gathered around.</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, and then the old man seemed
to draw himself up with pride, as they had seen him do in
life.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he said, distinctly, “my name is Burns—William
Shakespeare Burns—tragedian—at liberty.”</p>

<p>The old eyes closed, a faint sigh escaped his bloodless
lips, and the old actor was “at liberty.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink15'>CHAPTER XV.—A NEWSPAPER NOTICE.</h2>

<p>“Yesterday afternoon, through the courtesy of Manager
Frank Merriwell, an invited audience of at least five
hundred persons witnessed the first performance of Mr.
Merriwell’s revised and rewritten play at the Orpheum
Theater, and the verdict of that audience, which represented
the highest and most cultured element of Denver
society, was that the sprightly, sensational, four-act comedy
drama was a success in every way. The play, which
is now named ‘True Blue,’ was originally christened ‘For
Old Eli,’ and, after a single performance, Mr. Merriwell
withdrew it for the purpose of rewriting it, correcting certain
faults he had discovered, and strengthening one or
two weak points. As he wrote the piece, he was able to
do this work of reconstruction quickly and thoroughly,
and the result is a play of which he, as author, manager
and star performer, may well be proud. The following
is the cast:</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    DICK TRUEHEART               FRANK MERRIWELL<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Barry Hattleman              Douglas Dunton<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Spruce Downing               Rufus Small<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Crack Hyerman                Bartley Hodge<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Reuben Grass                 Ephraim Gallup<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Manny Sizzwell               William Wynne<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Prof. Gash                   Roscoe Havener<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Edwin Treadwell              William Shakespeare Burns<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Carius Dubad                 Granville Garland<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Spike Dubad                  Lester Vance<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Millie Blossom               Miss Cassie Lee<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Inez Dalton                  Miss Stella Stanley<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    Nancy Noodle                 Miss Agnes Kirk<br/>
</p>

<p>“College life is the principal theme of ‘True Blue,’ and
Mr. Merriwell, having studied at Yale, is quite capable of
catching the air and spirit of Old Eli, and reproducing it
on the stage. This he has done with a deftness and fidelity
that makes the play remarkable in its class, or, possibly
with greater accuracy, lifts it out of its class, for, up
to the production of this piece, all college plays have been
feeble attempts to catch the spirit of the life they represent,
or have descended into the realm of farce or burlesque.</p>

<p>“While the author of ‘True Blue’ has written a play to
suit the popular fancy, he has not considered it necessary
to write down to the general public, and, for all of the
college slang, which of a necessity is used by several of
the characters, there is nothing offensive in the entire
piece—nothing to shock the sensibilties of the most refined.
The comedy in places is a trifle boisterous, but that
was to be expected, and it does not descend to mere buffoonery.
It is the kind of comedy at which the spectator
must laugh, even though he may resolve that he will not,
and, when it is all over, he feels better for his laughter,
instead of feeling foolish, as he does in many cases after
witnessing other ‘popular plays.’</p>

<p>“The pathos strikes the right chord, and the strongest
situations and climaxes are stirring enough to thrill the
most sluggish blood. In some respects the story of the
play is rather conventional, but it is handled in a manner
that makes it seem almost new. Through the four acts
<i>Dick Trueheart</i>, the hero, is pursued by his enemies, <i>Carius
Dubad</i>, and his, worthy son, <i>Spike</i>, and on various
occasions they succeed in making things extremely unpleasant
for the popular young athlete.</p>

<p>“Through two acts the villains pursue the hero, keeping
the audience on the <i>qui vive</i>.</p>

<p>“The climax of the third act was the great sensational
feature of the play. In this act <i>Dick</i> escapes from his
enemies and all sorts of crafty snares, and is barely in
time to take his place in the Yale boat, which is to race
against Harvard and Cornell. <i>Carius Dubad</i> has appeared
on the scene, and, at the last moment, in order to
break <i>Dick’s</i> spirit, he reveals that <i>Dick’s</i> guardian has
squandered his fortune, so that the hero is penniless and
will be forced to leave college. For all of this revelation,
<i>Trueheart</i> enters the boat and aids in winning the race
against Harvard and Cornell, greatly to the discomfiture
of the villainous father and son, who have bet heavily
against Yale. Of course, Mr. Merriwell made Yale win
in his play. The mechanism that showed the boat race on
the distant river, the moving observation train, the swaying
crowds with waving flags, hats, and handkerchiefs,
was truly a most wonderful arrangement, and it filled the
spectators with admiration and astonishment. A quick
‘dark shift’ followed, and then the boats actually appeared,
with Yale the winner, and <i>Trueheart</i> was brought onto
the stage in the arms of his admiring fellow collegians,
while the curtain descended amid a burst of genuine enthusiastic
applause such as is seldom heard in any theater.
Mr. Merriwell was called before the curtain, and he made
a brief speech, which seemed modest and characteristic
of this young actor and playwright, who is certain to follow
a brilliant career on the American stage.</p>

<p>“In the final act the hero was in straitened circumstances,
but all ends well, with the discomfiture of old
<i>Dubad</i> and his worthy son, and the final settlement of all
jealousies between the other characters.</p>

<p>“Not only as author of the play, but as the star does
Frank Merriwell merit a full meed of credit and praise.
Although he is young and impulsive, and his acting might
not meet the approval of certain critics, there was a breeziness
and freshness about him that captivated and carried
the audience. It is said that he has never attended a
school of acting, and this may readily be believed, for
there is nothing affected, nothing stiff, nothing stilted and
mechanical about his work on the stage. In his case, at
least, it has been greatly to his advantage not to attend a
dramatic school. He is a born actor, and he must work
out his own methods without being hampered by convention
and instruction from those who believe in doing everything
by rule. He is a handsome young man, and his
stage presence is both striking and effective. Worthy of
note was it that he enunciated every word distinctly and
pronounced it correctly, in great contrast to many other
stars, who sometimes mangle speech in a most distressing
manner. He has a voice that seems in perfect keeping
with his splendid figure, being clear as a mellow bell,
full of force, and delightful to hear.</p>

<p>“The work of Douglas Dunton as <i>Barry Hattleman</i>
was good. Mr. Small, who is a very large man, faithfully
portrayed <i>Spruce Downing</i>, the lazy student. <i>Crack
Hyerman</i>, the hot-blooded Southerner, as represented by
Bartley Hodge, who made the Southerner a thorough fire-eater,
who would fight for his ‘honor’ at the drop of the
hat. As <i>Reuben Grass</i>, Ephraim Gallup literally convulsed
the audience. Without doubt his delineation of
the Down-East Yankee was the best ever seen in Denver.</p>

<p>“Miss Cassie Lee played the sweet and winsome <i>Millie
Blossom</i>, and her singing and dancing met approval. The
<i>Inez Dalton</i> of Miss Stanley was handled with great
skill, and she was jealous, passionate, resentful, and loving
in turn, and in a manner that seemed true to life. As
<i>Nancy Noodle</i>, an old maid in love with <i>Prof. Gash</i>,
Miss Agnes Kirk was acceptable.</p>

<p>“And now comes the duty of mentioning a man who
was the surprise of the evening. His name was given on
the program as William Shakespeare Burns, and, as he
represented a burlesque tragedian, it was supposed that
the name was assumed. It has been learned, however, that
this is the name by which he was known in real life. Mr.
Burns first appeared in the second act, and as <i>Edwin
Treadwell</i>, the frayed, back-number tragedian, he literally
caused many of the audience to choke in the effort
to repress their uncontrollable laughter. At the close
of the third act, a local theatrical man declared that W. S.
Burns far excelled as a comedian anybody he had ever
seen essay a similar part. But the sensation came in the
fourth act, when the actor started to parody <i>Hamlet’s</i> soliloquy,
but seemed to forget himself and the parody together,
and swung into the original William Shakespeare.
The laughter died out, the audience sat spellbound,
scarcely breathing. The eyes of every person were fixed
on the actor, who went through the soliloquy to the end,
giving it with all the power of a Forrest or a Booth. As
the actor retired, the audience awoke, realized it had seen
and heard a man who was no clown, but a real tragedian,
and the applause was long and loud.</p>

<p>“William Shakespeare Burns did not appear again on
the stage of that theater; he will not appear again on any
stage. He is dead! But few particulars have been learned
about him, but it seems that this was his first attempt to
play comedy—and his last. He regarded himself as the
equal of any interpreter of Shakespeare, living or dead,
but misfortune and his own weakness had never permitted
him to rise to the heights to which he aspired. Grim necessity
had compelled him to accept Mr. Merriwell’s offer
to play in ‘True Blue’ the part of the burlesque tragedian.
His heart and soul had rebelled against doing so, and
often at rehearsals he had wept with mortification after
going through with his part. His body was weakened by
privation. He declared last night that his heart was
broken. A few minutes after leaving the stage the last
time he expired in one of the dressing rooms of the theater.
Thus ended a life that might have been a grand success
but for the failings of weak human nature.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell will go on the road at once with ‘True
Blue.’ He has engaged a competent man to fill the place
made vacant by the death of Mr. Burns. His route for
some little time is booked, and he leaves Denver to-day for
Puelbo, where he opens to-morrow. The play, the star,
and the company merit success, and we hope Mr. Merriwell
will find it convenient to play a regular engagement
in this city before long. It is certain, if he does, he will be
greeted by packed houses.”—<i>Denver Herald and Advertiser.</i></p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>All the Denver papers contained notices of the performance,
but the one quoted was the longest and the most
elaborate. Not one of the notices was unfavorable. They
were enough to make the heart of any manager glad, and
it was not strange that Frank felt well satisfied.</p>

<p>But he was inexpressibly saddened by the sudden and
tragic death of William Burns, for he had recognized the
genius in the old actor, who had been dragged down from
a highroad to prosperity and fame by the hands of the
relentless demon that has destroyed so many men of
genius, drink.</p>

<p>On account of his bookings, Frank could not remain in
Denver to attend the funeral of the veteran tragedian,
but he resolved that Burns should be buried with all
honors, and he made arrangements for a suitable funeral.</p>

<p>Of course, the papers announced the funeral, and, the
story of Burns’ remarkable death having become familiar
to all, the church was packed to the doors. The man
whose wretched life had promised a wretched death and a
nameless grave was buried without pomp, but with such
honors as might have been given to one well known and
highly esteemed.</p>

<p>Above his grave a modest marble was placed, and chiseled
on it was a single line from the “Immortal Bard,”
whom he loved and understood and interpreted with the
faithfulness and fire of genius:</p>

<p>“After life’s fitful fever, he sleeps well.”</p>

<p>And every expense Frank Merriwell provided for.
Nothing was neglected; everything was done that good
taste and a good heart demanded.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink16'>CHAPTER XVI.—THE VEILED WOMAN.</h2>

<p>As may be understood, the members of Frank’s company
were individually and collectively delighted with the
apparent success of the play and their efforts. Perhaps
Agnes Kirk was the only one who complained. She was
not at all pleased by the notices she obtained.</p>

<p>Frank immediately secured a supply of Denver papers
and, marking the notices, mailed them to the managers of
theaters and the editors of papers along the route “True
Blue” was to follow.</p>

<p>Then he had typewritten copies made of extracts from
these notices, which he added to his collection of press
notices already manufactured for advertising purposes,
and sent them on to his advance agent, who had been out
on the road several days.</p>

<p>Frank knew how to work every point to the best advantage,
and he did not lose anything. He was tireless in his
efforts, and it was wonderful what an immense amount
of work he accomplished. No one knows how much he
can do till he makes the test.</p>

<p>Hodge aided him as far as possible, and Frank found
Bart a valuable assistant. Hodge was fully as eager as
Merriwell for the play to be a great success.</p>

<p>Frank had opened with the piece under its original name
in Puelbo, and it had met disaster there. He vowed that
he would return to that place with the play and make a
success of his engagement. He engaged the leading theater
in the city for three nights, being obliged to pay in
advance for it, as the manager had no confidence in the revised
play.</p>

<p>Frank had been working the papers of the city. One
of them was edited by a remarkably genial gentleman by
the name of Osgood, and this editor had seen in the original
play material for a strong piece. He admired Merry’s
pluck in opening the second time in that city, and he literally
opened the columns of his paper to Frank, who telegraphed
down extracts from the Denver papers as soon
as the notices appeared.</p>

<p>The house in Puelbo was to be well “papered” the first
night, but was to depend entirely on the drawing qualities
of the play for the audience on the following two nights.</p>

<p>Frank was making a great hustle to get away from
Denver, and he was returning from the theater to his
hotel, after seeing the last of the special scenery moved to
the railroad station, when a heavily veiled woman stopped
directly in his path. As he was walking hastily, he nearly
ran against her.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, madam!” exclaimed Frank, lifting
his hat. “Very awkward of me.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she said, in a low voice, that was not unpleasant
nor unmusical. “You were hurrying, and I
stopped directly in your way. I am the one who should
beg to be excused.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he hastened to say. “I assure you that it
was entirely on account of my awkwardness.”</p>

<p>He was about to pass on, but her gloved hand fell on his
arm, and she said:</p>

<p>“I wish to speak with you, Mr. Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“You know me?” exclaimed Frank, surprised.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do. Why should I not? All Denver knows
you to-day.”</p>

<p>“Am I so famous as that?” smiled Merry. “I fear you
flatter, madam.”</p>

<p>“It is not flattery. You must not doubt my sincerity.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will not; but you must speak hastily, for I
have a train to catch in an hour and thirty minutes, and I
haven’t too much time to attend to all I have to do.”</p>

<p>“But you must give me a little of your time—you really
must,” she said, persuasively, putting her hand on his arm
again. “If you will come with me—please do!”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know a nice, quiet place, where we can talk.”</p>

<p>Somehow Frank did not like her words or manner. A
feeling that there was something wrong about her came
over him.</p>

<p>“Really, you must excuse me,” he said. “I have not the
time to go anywhere to talk. If you have anything to say
to me, you can say it here.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t be obstinate. You’ll not regret it if you
come.”</p>

<p>“But I do not even know who you are. That veil——”</p>

<p>“If you come, I may remove the veil,” she murmured.</p>

<p>Frank drew back, so that her hand fell from his arm.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “you have placed me in a very awkward
position. I do not like to appear rude to a lady,
but——”</p>

<p>“Of course you do not, and so you will grant my request.
It is a small matter.”</p>

<p>“But not to me, for my time is valuable just now. I am
ready to hear anything you have to say, but you must say
it here.”</p>

<p>“Would you keep a lady standing on the street?” she exclaimed,
with a slight show of resentment. “I cannot say
all I have to tell you in a minute.”</p>

<p>“And I have explained that I cannot spare time to talk
over anything for more than a few moments. I think you
will have to excuse me. Good-day.”</p>

<p>He lifted his hat and started to pass on, but again she
placed herself squarely in front of him, to his great annoyance.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell,” she said, “I have seen you on the
stage, and I admire you greatly. You will not be rude
to one of your admirers, I know. You are far too gallant
for that.”</p>

<p>It was plain she sought to cajole him by flattery, and
that was the surest way to repulse him.</p>

<p>“Is it possible she is one of those foolish women who
fall in love with actors?” Frank asked himself.</p>

<p>Somehow she did not seem like that. There was nothing
of the giddy, gushing girl about her. He could not
see her face, but her figure was that of a matured woman,
and he judged that she must be twenty-five years old, at
least. It seemed, too, that there was a purpose in her
words and movements.</p>

<p>But Frank resolved on action, for he had found that it
was useless to waste words talking to her. He made a
quick move to one side and passed her, intending to hasten
away.</p>

<p>Barely had he done so when she flung her arms about
his neck and screamed loudly!</p>

<p>Frank was astounded by this unexpected move of the
veiled woman.</p>

<p>“She’s crazy!”</p>

<p>That was the thought that flashed through Merry’s
mind.</p>

<p>He realized that he was in an awkward predicament,
and he attempted to whirl about.</p>

<p>The woman was very strong, and, having taken him
by surprise, she nearly threw him down. To save himself,
he caught hold of her.</p>

<p>“Help!” she cried.</p>

<p>Some men came running up.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Frank, hurriedly, “are you demented?
What is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>“You wretch!” she blazed. “Oh, you cowardly scoundrel,
to assault a lady on the public street in broad daylight!”</p>

<p>“Surely you are——”</p>

<p>“I saw him do it!” declared a little man, with red whiskers.
“I saw him assault you, madam.”</p>

<p>“Call an officer!” palpitated the woman. “Quick, before
he gets away!”</p>

<p>“He shall not get away,” declared a big man with a
crooked eye, glowering at Frank. “If he tries it, I’ll
attend to him!”</p>

<p>“Looks like a would-be masher,” piped a slim man,
with a very long neck, ducking and nodding his head in
an odd manner. “He should be taught a lesson.”</p>

<p>One or two others expressed themselves in a similar
manner.</p>

<p>Frank had thought of making a break and hastening
away, but now he saw it would not do, for he would have
a howling mob at his heels the instant he attempted such
a move. He realized it would seem cowardly to run
away in such a manner, and would look like a confession
of guilt, which caused him to decide to stay and face it
out, even though the predicament was most embarrassing.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, looking squarely at them, and
seeming to pay very little attention to the mysterious
woman, even though he was perfectly on his guard, not
knowing what move she might make next, “I trust you
will give me a chance to explain what has happened.”</p>

<p>“Explain it in the police court,” growled the big man
with a crooked eye. “That’s the proper place for you
to make your explanations.”</p>

<p>“The judge will listen to you,” cried the slim man, his
head bobbing on his long neck, like the head of a crane
that is walking along the edge of a marsh.</p>

<p>“Don’t attempt to escape by means of falsehoods, you
rascal!” almost shouted the little man with the red whiskers,
bristling up in a savage manner, but dodging back
the moment Frank turned on him.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I have been insulted by this fellow!” came
from behind the baffling veil worn by the woman. “He
is a low wretch, who attacked me in a most brutal manner.”</p>

<p>“We will see that you are protected, madam,” assured
the little man, his red whiskers seeming to bristle like
porcupine quills, as he dodged round Frank and placed
himself on the opposite side of the veiled unknown.
“Madam,” he repeated, “I will see that you are protected—I
will!”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” she fluttered; “but where is the
officer? The reaction—the shock—the weakness!”</p>

<p>“Permit me to offer you any assistance possible,” gallantly
spoke a man in a sack coat and a silk hat, stepping
forward and raising the latter piece of wearing apparel,
thereby disclosing a shining bald spot on the top of his
head, which he covered as quickly as possible, evidently
hoping it had escaped the woman’s notice. “You are in
a city, my dear lady, where insults to the fair sex never
go unpunished.”</p>

<p>He attempted to smile on her in a pleasant manner,
but there was a sort of leer in his eyes and around his
sensual mouth that betrayed his true character plainly
enough.</p>

<p>The woman did not accept his arm which was half
tendered, but she made a great show of agitation and
distress, which affected the various witnesses.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame!” piped the man with the long neck and
the bobbing head.</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage!” blustered the little man with the
bristling whiskers and savage manner.</p>

<p>“It’s most unfortunate!” murmured the gallant man
with the silk hat and sack coat.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad break for Mr. Masher!” ejaculated the big
man with the crooked eye and glowering look.</p>

<p>Frank smiled; he could not help it, for he was impressed
by the comedy of the affair, despite the unpleasantness
of the situation he was in at that moment.</p>

<p>“This would be good stuff for a scene in a play,” he
thought, and he made a mental note of it.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the woman.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “what have I ever done to you
that you should attempt to injure me in this manner?”</p>

<p>“Don’t let him speak to me, the scoundrel!” she entreated,
appealing to the men.</p>

<p>“But it is no more than fair that you should answer
me,” persisted Merry. “I do not know you; I have not
even seen your face. Will you not lift your veil and permit
me to see your face, so that I may know who has
brought me into this unpleasant position?”</p>

<p>“He adds to his insults by requesting me to expose my
identity on the street after such an affair as this!” she
almost sobbed. “He would disgrace me! He would
have my name in all the newspapers!”</p>

<p>“Reprehensible!” purred the gallant man.</p>

<p>“Terrible!” cackled the man with the bobbing head.</p>

<p>“Dastardly!” exploded the individual with the red
whiskers.</p>

<p>“Criminal!” grated the giant with the crooked eye.</p>

<p>And they all glared at Frank—at least all of them but
the one with the crooked eye. It is possible that he, also,
glared at the supposed offender, but he seemed to be
glaring at a white horse on the opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>Repressing his laughter with difficulty, Merry said:</p>

<p>“I assure you, gentlemen, I never saw this lady, to my
knowledge, before a few minutes ago, when she stopped
me on the street, and——”</p>

<p>Again the woman screamed.</p>

<p>“Will you listen to his base falsehoods?” she cried,
with a show of the greatest indignation and distress.
“He is trying to disgrace me still further by asserting
that I stopped him on the street—stopped him! As if
a lady would do such a thing!”</p>

<p>“The idea!” squawked the man with the long neck,
his head seeming to bob faster than ever, as if it sought
to express by its excited movements the indignant emotions
his tongue could not utter.</p>

<p>“My dear lady, I would not remain here to be thus
insulted,” declared the gallant man, bending toward her,
and endeavoring to summon a look of concern to his
treacherous countenance.</p>

<p>“He should be placed in irons!” blurted the fierce-appearing
little man, his red whiskers seeming to work
and squirm with intense excitement and anger.</p>

<p>“He ought to have his head broken!” roared the big
man, his crooked eye still seeming to glare at the white
horse in a most terrible and awesome manner.</p>

<p>Others of the assembled crowd murmured to themselves
in a most indignant manner, all seeming to regard
Frank as the offender.</p>

<p>Frank took out his watch and looked at it.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” he mentally exclaimed, “time is flying.
If this keeps up much longer, I’ll not reach Puelbo to-day.”</p>

<p>“Now he shows his anxiety and concern,” said a voice
in the crowd.</p>

<p>“He’s beginning to be frightened,” said another voice.</p>

<p>“He’s anxious to get away,” said a third.</p>

<p>“But he can’t get away,” said a fourth.</p>

<p>“This is all very interesting,” thought Frank; “but
it is decidedly unpleasant.”</p>

<p>“Waal, whut in time’s sake is goin’ on here, I’d like
ter know?” cried a voice that was familiar to Frank, and
a tall, lank, countrified-appearing youth came up to the
outskirts of the crowd, stood on his tiptoes, and peered
over.</p>

<p>It was Ephraim Gallup, and he saw Frank.</p>

<p>“Waal, darned if it ain’t——”</p>

<p>Merry made a swift movement, clapping a finger to
his lips, and Gallup, usually rather slow to tumble to
anything, understood him at once, relapsing into silence.</p>

<p>“Let me git in here where I kin see the fun,” he said,
and he elbowed the people aside as he forced his way
through the crowd.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to reach the center of the
throng, although a number of persons were indignant
at his manner of thrusting them aside or stepping on
their feet.</p>

<p>“Whut’s up?” he asked. “Ef there’s anything goin’
on, I kainder want to see it.”</p>

<p>“This young masher has insulted this lady!” explained
the man with the bobbing head.</p>

<p>“Sho!” exclaimed Gallup. “Yeou don’t say so, mister!
Waal, I am s’prised!”</p>

<p>“He has treated her in an outrageous manner!” added
the man with the agitated and fiery whiskers.</p>

<p>“I do declare!” ejaculated Ephraim. “I’d never
thought it of him, by thutter!”</p>

<p>“The lady requires protection,” declared the gallant
man with the mismated wearing apparel.</p>

<p>“Yeou don’t tell me!” gasped the Vermonter, his surprise
seeming to increase. “Ain’t it awful!”</p>

<p>“But the fellow needs a lesson!” rasped the man with
the eye that persisted in looking in the wrong direction.
“I think I’ll hit him once or twice.”</p>

<p>“My gracious!” fluttered Gallup. “Hev ye gotter hit
him real hard? Don’t yeou s’pose he might hit back?”</p>

<p>“Let him try it!” came fiercely from the giant.</p>

<p>“Be yeou goin’ to hit where ye’re lookin’?” asked the
country youth. “Cause ef yeou be, I’d advise that man
with the wart on his nose to move.”</p>

<p>At this the man who owned the wart dodged with a
suddenness that provoked a titter of laughter from several
witnesses.</p>

<p>Ephraim was adding to the comedy of the affair, and
Frank bit his lips to keep from laughing outright, despite
his annoyance over being thus detained.</p>

<p>The big man with the crooked eye flourished his fists
in the air in a most belligerent fashion, and instantly
Merriwell gazed at him sternly, saying:</p>

<p>“Be careful, sir! You are imperiling the lives of
everyone near you, and you may strain yourself.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, by gum!” nodded Gallup, whimsically.
“Yeou may warp one of them air arms, flingin’ it araound
so gol-darn permiscuous like.”</p>

<p>“Here comes an officer!”</p>

<p>Somebody uttered the cry.</p>

<p>“It is high time!” exclaimed the little man, trying to
soothe his agitated whiskers by pulling at them.</p>

<p>“It surely is,” croaked the lank individual, his head
bobbing with renewed excitement.</p>

<p>“Madam, the law will give you redress,” bowed the
gallant man, again taking off his silk hat and again clapping
it on suddenly, as if a breath of cool air on his
shining pate had warned him of the exposure he was
making.</p>

<p>“Oh, why didn’t the officer stay away a minute longer,
so I might have thumped him!” regretfully grunted the
fighting man with the misdirected eye.</p>

<p>The policeman came up and forced his way through
the crowd, demanding:</p>

<p>“What does this mean? What is happening here?”</p>

<p>“A lady is in trouble,” the bobbing man hastened to
explain.</p>

<p>“In serious trouble,” chirped the bewhiskered man.</p>

<p>“She has been insulted,” declared the gallant man.</p>

<p>“By a masher,” finished the man with the errant eye.</p>

<p>“Where is the lady?” asked the officer.</p>

<p>“There!”</p>

<p>All bowed politely toward the masked woman.</p>

<p>“Where is the masher?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“There!”</p>

<p>Their scornful fingers were leveled straight at Frank
Merriwell.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink17'>CHAPTER XVII.—ARRESTED.</h2>

<p>“Oh, sir!” exclaimed the woman, “I beg you to protect
me from his insults!”</p>

<p>The officer was a gallant fellow. He touched his hat
and bowed with extreme politeness. Then he frowned
on Merry, and that frown was terrible to behold. He
gripped Frank by the collar, gruffly saying:</p>

<p>“You’ll have to come with me.”</p>

<p>Merry knew it was useless to attempt to explain under
such circumstances. Every one of the assembled crowd
would be a witness against him.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, quietly. “I am quite willing to
do so. Please do not twist my necktie off.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about your necktie!” advised the policeman,
giving it a still harder twist. “I know how to deal
with chaps of your caliber.”</p>

<p>Now of a sudden Ephraim Gallup began to grow
angry. He did not fancy seeing his idol treated in such
a manner, and his fists were clenched, while he glared
at the officer as if contemplating hitting that worthy.</p>

<p>“It’s a gol-dern shame!” he grated. “This jest makes
my blood bile!”</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder a bit,” piped the long-necked man,
misunderstanding the Vermonter; “but the officer will
take care of him now. He’ll get what he deserves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will he!” exploded Gallup. “Waal, ef I was yeou,
I’d hire myself aout to some dime museum as the human
bobber. Yeou teeter jest like a certun bird that I won’t
name.”</p>

<p>“Wh—a—at?” squealed the individual addressed, in great
excitement. “This to me! Why, I’ll——”</p>

<p>“I wish ter great goshfrey yeou would!” hissed
Ephraim, glaring at him. “I’d jest like to hev yeou try
it! I’d give yeou a jolt that’d knock yeou clean inter
the middle of next week!”</p>

<p>“Why, who is this fellow that seeks to create a disturbance?”
blustered the little man, his fiery whiskers
beginning to bristle and squirm again. “He should be
sat upon.”</p>

<p>The country youth turned on him.</p>

<p>“I wish yeou’d tackle the job, yeou condemned little
red-whiskered runt;” he shot at the blusterer with such
suddenness that the little man staggered back and put
up his hands, as if he had been struck. “Yeou are another
meddler! I’d eat yeou, an’ I’d never know I’d
hed a bite!”</p>

<p>“This is very unfortunate, madam,” purred the gallant
man at the veiled woman’s side. “I am extremely sorry
that you have had such an unpleasant experience. Now,
if that creature——”</p>

<p>He designated Ephraim by the final word, and Gallup
cut him short right there.</p>

<p>“Yeou’re the cheapest one of the hull lot, old oil-smirk!”
he flung at the speaker. “Such fellers as yeou are more
dangerous to real ladies than all the young mashers goin’,
fer yeou are a hypocrite who pretends to be virtuous.”</p>

<p>The man gasped and tried to say something, but seemed
stricken speechless.</p>

<p>Now the cock-eyed man was aroused once more. He
seemed on the point of making a swing at somebody or
something. He pushed his face up close to Ephraim,
but still his rebellious eye seemed looking in quite another
direction.</p>

<p>“If you want any trouble here,” he said, hoarsely, “I’ll
attend to you. I can do that very well.”</p>

<p>Ephraim looked at him, began to smile, broke into a
grin, and burst into a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>“Haw! haw! haw!” he roared. “I couldn’t fight with
yeou ef I wanted to, fer I’d think yeou didn’t mean me
all the time, but that yeou really ought to be fightin’ with
some other feller yeou was lookin’ at. Yeou’re the funniest
toad in the hull puddle!”</p>

<p>“I’ll arrest the whole lot of you!” threatened the policeman.
“Quit that business! Come along to the police
station if you want to make any complaints.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to the woman, saying:</p>

<p>“Madam, I presume you will make a complaint against
this fellow,” indicating Frank.</p>

<p>“I certainly shall,” she promptly answered; “for it is
my duty to teach him a lesson.”</p>

<p>“Will you come to the station?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Permit me to accompany you,” urged the gallant man.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” she said; “but I think I can get
along. I will follow at a distance.”</p>

<p>“All right,” nodded the officer, once more gripping
Merriwell’s collar savagely. “March, sir!”</p>

<p>And then they started toward the station.</p>

<p>The bobbing man, the little man, the cock-eyed man,
and the gallant man formed behind. Then the crowd
fell in, and away they went, with the mysterious veiled
woman following at a distance.</p>

<p>Ephraim placed himself at Frank’s side.</p>

<p>“This is a gol-darn outrage!” fumed the Vermonter,
speaking to Merry. “Whut be yeou goin’ to do abaout
it?”</p>

<p>“I shall have to do the best I can,” answered the
unfortunate youth, quietly.</p>

<p>“But yeou won’t be able to start for Puelbo with the
rest of the people.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look that way now.”</p>

<p>“That’s tough!”</p>

<p>“It is decidedly unfortunate, but I hope to get off in
time to join the company before the first performance
to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Haow did it happen?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know. The woman stopped me and insisted
that I should go somewhere to talk with her. I explained
that my time was limited, but that seemed to make no
impression on her. When I tried to get away she flung
her arms around me and screamed. That brought a crowd
together, and then she declared I had assaulted her.”</p>

<p>The policeman on the other side of Frank laughed in
ridicule. Although he said nothing, it was plain he took
no stock in Frank’s story.</p>

<p>“Larf!” grated Gallup, under his breath. “Yeou think
yeou know so gol-darned much that——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned Frank. “I do not wish you to get
into trouble. You must inform the others what has happened
to me.”</p>

<p>“It’s purty gol-darn hard to keep still,” declared
Ephraim. “I never see sich a set of natteral born fools
in all my life! How many of the craowd saw what happened
’tween yeou an’ the woman?”</p>

<p>“No one, I think.”</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll bet a squash they’ll all go up an’ swear to
any kind of a story she’ll tell. Who is she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer. Wut was her little game?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know that.”</p>

<p>“By gum! it’s some kind of a put-up job!”</p>

<p>“I have a fancy there is something more than appears
on the surface. It is an attempt to make trouble for me.”</p>

<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>“I hope to see the woman’s face at the police station.”</p>

<p>“Yeou won’t!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“She won’t show it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the judge will request her to lift her veil.”</p>

<p>“Not by a gol-darned sight! Men are too big fools
over women. They’ll take any old thing she’ll say abaout
yeou, an’ lock yeou up fer it. She’ll give some kind of
name and address, an’ they’ll let her go at that.”</p>

<p>“Well, unless I can get bail right away I shall be in
a bad fix. If Kent Carson were in town he would pull
me out of it, as he did before.”</p>

<p>The officer pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he exclaimed. “Then you have been arrested
in Denver before? This is a second offense! I rather
think you’ll not get off as easy as you did the first time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yeou are enough to——”</p>

<p>“Ephraim!”</p>

<p>With that word Frank cut Gallup short.</p>

<p>In a short time they approached the police station.</p>

<p>“I have been here before,” said Merry, quietly. “This
is the station to which I was taken when Leslie Lawrence
made his false charge against me.”</p>

<p>Entering, he was taken before the desk of the sergeant,
the bobbing man, the little man, the cock-eyed man, and
the gallant man following closely, while others also came
in.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked up.</p>

<p>“Ah, Brandon,” he said to the officer, “another one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the policeman.</p>

<p>“What is the charge?”</p>

<p>“Insulting a lady on the street.”</p>

<p>“Who was the lady?”</p>

<p>“She is coming. She will be here directly to make the
complaint against him.”</p>

<p>Then the sergeant took a good look at the accused.
He started, bent forward, and looked closer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Merriwell!” he exclaimed; “is it you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sergeant,” bowed Frank, with a smile. “It seems
to be my luck to cause you trouble once more.”</p>

<p>“Trouble!” ejaculated the man behind the desk. “Why,
this is very surprising! And you are accused of insulting
a lady?”</p>

<p>“I am,” was the quiet answer.</p>

<p>“Well! well! well! It hardly seems possible. I fail
to understand why you should do such a thing. It was
very kind of you to send me tickets for your performance
yesterday, and I was fortunate to be able to attend. I
was greatly pleased, both with your play and yourself,
to say nothing of your supporting company. I see the
papers have given you a great send-off, but it is no better
than you merit.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Frank, simply.</p>

<p>The policeman began to look disturbed, while the bobbing
man, the little man, the gallant man, and the cock-eyed
man all stared at Frank and the sergeant in surprise.</p>

<p>“You seem to recognize the offender, sir,” said the
officer who had arrested Frank.</p>

<p>“I recognize the gentleman, Brandon,” said the sergeant,
putting particular emphasis on the word “gentleman.”</p>

<p>“He said he had been arrested before.”</p>

<p>“He was, on a trumped-up charge, and he was promptly
dismissed by me.”</p>

<p>The officer looked still more disturbed.</p>

<p>“But this is no trumped-up charge,” he declared. “I
have witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Where are they?”</p>

<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>He motioned toward the men, who had followed closely
on entering the station, whereupon the little man drew
himself up stiffly, as if he imagined he must be six feet tall,
at least; the bobbing man bobbed in a reckless manner, as
if he had quite lost control of himself; the gallant man
lifted his hat and mopped the shiny spot on the top of his
head with a silk handkerchief, attempting to appear perfectly
at ease; and the cock-eyed man made a desperate
attempt to look the sergeant straight in the eye, but came
no nearer than the upper corner of the station window,
which was several yards away to the left.</p>

<p>“And where is the lady who makes the charge?”
demanded the man behind the desk.</p>

<p>Where, indeed! It was time for her to appear, but all
looked for her in vain.</p>

<p>“She must be here directly,” said the sergeant, “if she
is coming at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is coming!” hastily answered the officer.</p>

<p>“She may be waiting outside, hesitating about coming
in,” said the sergeant. “You may go out and bring her
in, Brandon.”</p>

<p>The policeman hesitated an instant, as if he feared to
leave Frank.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” asserted the sergeant. “I will guarantee
that Mr. Merriwell is quite safe.”</p>

<p>Then Brandon hurried out.</p>

<p>“I believe you are going on the road with your play,
Mr. Merriwell?” said the sergeant, in a most friendly
and affable manner.</p>

<p>“I am,” answered Frank, “if I succeed in getting
started.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“Well,” smiled Merry, “I was due to take a train in
one hour and thirty minutes when I was accosted by the
unknown woman whom it is said I insulted. I hardly
think I shall be able to catch that train now.”</p>

<p>The sergeant looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“How much time have you now?” he asked.</p>

<p>Frank consulted his timepiece.</p>

<p>“Just forty-one minutes,” he said.</p>

<p>“Will you kindly tell me what occurred on the street?”
invited the sergeant. “But wait—first I wish to know
who witnessed this assault.”</p>

<p>There was some hesitation as the official behind the
desk looked the assembled crowd over.</p>

<p>“Come,” he cried, sharply. “Who knows anything
about this affair?”</p>

<p>“I do,” asserted the man with the cock-eye, summoning
courage to step forward a bit. “And here are others.”</p>

<p>“Which ones?”</p>

<p>“Him, and him, and him,” answered the crooked-eyed
man, jabbing a pudgy and none too clean forefinger at
the gallant man, the little man, and the bobbing man,
although he seemed to look at three entirely different
persons from those he named.</p>

<p>The gallant man was perspiring, and looked as if he
longed to escape. He also seemed anxious over the non-appearance
of the veiled lady.</p>

<p>The bobbing man took a step backward, but somebody
pushed him from behind, and he bobbed himself nearly
double.</p>

<p>The little man tugged at his fluttering whiskers, looking
to the right and left, as if thinking of dodging and
attempting to escape in a hurry.</p>

<p>“And these are the witnesses?” said the sergeant, his
eyes seeming to pierce them through and through. “Their
testimony against you shall be carefully heard, Mr. Merriwell,
and it will be well for them to be careful about
giving it.”</p>

<p>“If I understand what is proper,” said the cock-eyed
man, who seemed the only one who dared speak outright,
“this is not the court, and you are not the judge.”</p>

<p>But he subsided before the piercing eyes of the sergeant,
so that his final words were scarcely more than
a gurgle in his throat.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Merriwell,” said the sergeant, “I will listen
to your story. Officer at the door, take care that none
of the witnesses depart until they are given permission.”</p>

<p>Frank told his story briefly, concisely, and convincingly.
Barely had he finished when the officer who made the
arrest came in, looking crestfallen and disgusted.</p>

<p>“Where is the lady, Brandon?” asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“I can’t find her, sir,” confessed the policeman. “She
is nowhere in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>“Then it seems you have been very careless in permitting
her to slip away. Now there is no one to make
a charge against the prisoner.”</p>

<p>“The witnesses—perhaps some of them will do so.”</p>

<p>The sergeant turned sharply on the little man, to whom
he fired the question:</p>

<p>“Did you witness this assault on the unknown lady,
sir?”</p>

<p>The little man jumped.</p>

<p>“No, sus-sus-sir,” he stammered; “but I——”</p>

<p>“That will do!” came sternly from the man behind the
desk. “Step aside.”</p>

<p>The little man did so with alacrity, plainly relieved.</p>

<p>Then the sergeant came at the gallant man with the
same question:</p>

<p>“Did you witness the assault on the lady, sir?”</p>

<p>“I was not present when it took place, but I——”</p>

<p>“That will do! Step aside.”</p>

<p>The gallant man closed up and stepped.</p>

<p>Next the bobbing man was questioned:</p>

<p>“Did you witness the assault on the lady, sir?”</p>

<p>“I arrived just after it was committed, but I can tell
you——”</p>

<p>“Nothing! That will do! Step aside.”</p>

<p>The cock-eyed man folded his arms across his breast
and glared fiercely at the window, which seemed to offend
him.</p>

<p>“You are next.” said the sergeant. “What did you
see?”</p>

<p>“I saw quite enough to convince me that the assault
had been committed before I reached the spot, but——”</p>

<p>“Another ‘but.’ ‘But me no buts.’ There seems to
be no one present who witnessed the assault, and so no
one can prefer a charge against Mr. Merriwell. Mr. Merriwell,
you have now exactly thirty minutes in which to
catch your train. Don’t stop to say a word, but git up
and git. You are at liberty.”</p>

<p>And Frank took the sergeant’s advice, followed closely
by Ephraim.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink18'>CHAPTER XVIII.—AT THE LAST MOMENT.</h2>

<p>Frank Merriwell’s company had gathered at the railway
station to take the train for Puelbo. All but Merriwell
and Gallup were on hand. Havener had purchased
the tickets.</p>

<p>Hodge restlessly paced up and down the platform, his
face dark and disturbed.</p>

<p>There were inquiries for Frank. Stella Stanley came
to Havener and asked:</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” confessed the stage manager, who
had been deputized for the occasion by Frank to look out
for tickets, and make necessary arrangements.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t come?”</p>

<p>“No; but he’ll be here before the train pulls out. You
know he has a way of always appearing on time.”</p>

<p>Hodge stopped in his walk, and stared at Havener.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know when he left the hotel,” said Bart.
“I called for him several times before coming here, but
each time I found he was not in his room, and no one
knew anything about him. His bill was not settled,
either.”</p>

<p>“But his baggage came down with the others,” said
Havener.</p>

<p>“Because the hotel people permitted it, as he was
vouched for by Mr. Carson, who seems to be well known
to everybody in this city.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose anything has happened to detain
him, do you?” anxiously asked the actress. “I do hope
we shall not make another bad start, same as we did
before. Agnes Kirk says she knows something will happen,
for Mr. Merriwell gave away the cat Mascot.”</p>

<p>“Agnes Kirk is forever prophesying something dismal,”
said Hodge. “She’s a regular croaker. If she didn’t have
something to croak about, she wouldn’t know what to do.
She declared the cat a hoodoo in the first place, but now
she says we’ll have bad luck because Frank let it go. She
makes me a trifle weary!”</p>

<p>Hodge was not in a pleasant humor.</p>

<p>Granville Garland and Lester Vance came up.</p>

<p>“It’s almost train time,” said Garland. “Where is our
energetic young manager?”</p>

<p>“He will be along,” Havener again asserted.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Vance. “I sincerely hope this second
venture will not prove such a miserable fizzle as the
first one. Everything depends on Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Something depends on you!” flashed Hodge, who
seemed easily nettled. “Frank Merriwell’s company did
all it could to make the first venture a fizzle. Now they
should do all they can to make this one a success.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Thundercloud is lowering!” exclaimed Garland.</p>

<p>“Save your epithets!” exclaimed Bart. “My name is
Hodge.”</p>

<p>“My dear Hodge,” said Garland, with mock politeness,
“you must know it is but natural that we should feel a
bit anxious.”</p>

<p>“I may feel as anxious as any of you, but I do not go
round croaking about it.”</p>

<p>“But our first failure——”</p>

<p>“There it is again! I’m tired of hearing about that!
You and Vance are dead lucky to be in this second company,
for you both joined in the attempted assault on
Merriwell when Folansbee skipped, and the company
seemed to be stranded in Puelbo. If I’d been Frank Merriwell
I’d sent you flying, and you can bet I would not
have taken you back.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s fortunate for us that you were not Frank
Merriwell,” Garland sneered.</p>

<p>“It is,” agreed Hodge. “Some people do not know
when they are treated well.”</p>

<p>“That will do!” came sharply from Havener. “This
is no time to quarrel. By Jove! it’s time for that train,
and Merriwell’s not here.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s backed out at the last minute and decided
not to take the play out,” said Vance. “It may be that
his courage has failed him.”</p>

<p>“Now that kind of talk makes me sick!” exploded
Hodge. “If you had any sense you wouldn’t make it!”</p>

<p>“I like that!” snapped Vance, his face flushing.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you do!” flung back Bart. “Didn’t think
you would. Hoped you wouldn’t. Only a fool would
suppose that, after all this trouble and expense, any man
with an ounce of brains in his head would back out without
giving a single performance of the play.”</p>

<p>“Well, where is Merriwell?”</p>

<p>Again Havener declared:</p>

<p>“He’ll be here.”</p>

<p>“But here comes the train!”</p>

<p>The train was coming. There was activity and bustle
at the station. The platform was alive with moving human
beings. Agnes Kirk and Cassie Lee came out of
the ladies’ waiting room. The male members of the
company got together quickly.</p>

<p>“He has not come!” exclaimed Agnes Kirk, her keen
eyes failing to discover Frank. “I feared it! I knew it!”</p>

<p>Hodge half turned away, grumbling something deep
in his throat.</p>

<p>The actors looked at each other in doubt and dismay.</p>

<p>With a rush and a roar the train came in, and drew
up at the station. Passengers began to get off.</p>

<p>A heavily veiled woman in black came out of the ladies’
room, and started for the train. As she passed the group
of actors some of their conversation seemed to attract
her notice. She paused an instant and looked them over,
and then she turned toward the steps of a car.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, madam,” said Hodge, quickly. “You
have dropped your handkerchief.”</p>

<p>He picked it up and passed it to her. As he did so,
he noticed the letters “L. F.” on one corner.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>At that moment, for the last time, Havener was reiterating:</p>

<p>“I believe Frank Merriwell will be here. All get onto
the train. He never gets left.”</p>

<p>Then the woman tossed her head a bit and laughed.
It was a scornful laugh, and it attracted the attention
of several of the group. She turned quickly, and stepped
into the nearest car.</p>

<p>“Something tells me he will not arrive,” declared Agnes
Kirk. “The hoodoo is still on. This company will meet
the same fate the other did.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so much about it,” advised Havener, rather
rudely. “Get onto the train—everybody!”</p>

<p>Hodge was staring after the veiled woman.</p>

<p>“Wonder what made her laugh like that?” he muttered.
“Seems to me I’ve heard that laugh before. It
seemed full of scornful triumph. I wonder——”</p>

<p>He did not express his second wonder.</p>

<p>“Come, Hodge,” said Havener, “get aboard. Follow
the others.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be the last one,” said Hodge. “I’m waiting for
Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” confessed Havener, beginning to weaken.</p>

<p>“Afraid of what?” Hodge almost hissed.</p>

<p>“It begins to look bad,” admitted the stage manager.
“I’m afraid something has happened to Frank. If he
doesn’t come——”</p>

<p>“I don’t go,” declared Bart. “I shall stay and find
out what has happened to him. You must go. You
must sit on those croakers. Your place is with the company;
mine is with Frank Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“All aboard!”</p>

<p>The conductor gave the warning.</p>

<p>“What’s this?”</p>

<p>Rattle-te-bang, on the dead jump, a cab was coming
along the street. The cabman was putting the whip to
his foaming horses.</p>

<p>“He’s coming,” said Hodge, with cool triumph, putting
his hands into his trousers pockets, and waiting the approach
of the cab.</p>

<p>Something made him feel certain of it. Up to the
platform dashed the cab, the driver flinging the horses
back, and flinging himself to the platform to fling open
the door.</p>

<p>Dong dong!</p>

<p>The train was starting.</p>

<p>Out of the cab leaped Frank Merriwell, grip in hand.
At his heels Ephraim Gallup came sprawling.</p>

<p>Bart was satisfied, Havener was delighted. Both of
them sprang on board the train. Across the platform
dashed Frank and the Vermont youth, and they also
boarded the moving cars.</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Merry, easily, “that was what I call
a close call. Ten dollars to the cabby did it, and he
earned his sawbuck.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you!” cried Havener. “I confess I
had given you up. But what happened to detain you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but a little adventure,” answered Merry,
coolly. “I’ll tell you about it.”</p>

<p>They followed him into the car.</p>

<p>Several members of the company had been looking
from the car window, and the arrival of Frank had been
witnessed. They gave a shout as he entered the car, and
all were on their feet.</p>

<p>“Welcome!” cried Douglas Dunton, dramatically—“welcome,
most noble one! Methinks thou couldst not
do it better in a play. It was great stuff—flying cab,
foaming horses, moving train, and all that. Make a
note of it.”</p>

<p>“I believe he did it on purpose,” declared Agnes Kirk,
speaking to Vance, with whom she had taken a seat.</p>

<p>“Very likely,” admitted Lester. “Wanted to do something
to attract attention.”</p>

<p>“I think it was mean! He fooled us.”</p>

<p>But several members of the company shook hands with
Frank, and congratulated him.</p>

<p>“I told you he would not get left,” said Havener, with
triumph.</p>

<p>At the rear end of the car was a veiled woman, who
seemed to sink down behind those in front of her, as
if she sought to avoid detection. Somehow, although her
face could not be seen, there was in her appearance something
that betokened disappointment and chagrin.</p>

<p>Of course Frank was pressed for explanations, but he
told them that business had detained him. He did not
say what kind of business.</p>

<p>At length, however, with Hodge, Havener and Gallup
for listeners, all seated on two facing seats, he told the
story of his adventure with the veiled woman, and his
arrest, which ended in a discharge that barely permitted
him to leap into a cab, race to the hotel, get his grip, pay
his bill, and dash to the station in time to catch the train.</p>

<p>As the story progressed Hodge showed signs of increasing
excitement. When Merry finished, Bart exclaimed:</p>

<p>“How did the woman look?”</p>

<p>“I did not see her face.”</p>

<p>“How was she dressed? Describe her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know as I can.”</p>

<p>“Do the best you can.”</p>

<p>Frank did so, and Bart cried:</p>

<p>“I’ve seen her!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Merry was astonished.</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” asserted Bart. “I have seen that
very same woman!”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“To-day.”</p>

<p>“How long ago?”</p>

<p>“A very short time.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At the station while we were waiting for you to
appear.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible. How do you know it was her?”</p>

<p>Then Bart told of the strange woman who had dropped
her handkerchief, of the initials he had seen when he
picked it up, and of her singularly scornful laugh when
she heard Havener declare that Merriwell never got left.</p>

<p>All this interested Frank very much. Bart concluded
by saying:</p>

<p>“That woman is on this very train!”</p>

<p>“Waal, may I be tickled to death by grasshoppers!”
ejaculated the youth from Vermont. “Whut in thunder
do yeou s’pose she’s up to?”</p>

<p>“It may be the same one,” said Frank. “It would be
remarkable if it should prove to be the same one. Two
women might look so much alike that the description
of one would exactly fit the other—especially if both were
heavily veiled.”</p>

<p>Bart shook his head.</p>

<p>“Something tells me it is the same woman,” he persisted.</p>

<p>“But why should she be on this train?”</p>

<p>“Who can answer that? Why did she try such a trick
on the street?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” admitted Merry. “Once I thought it
might be that she was mashed on me, but it didn’t prove
that way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno,” drawled Gallup, with a queer grin.
“Yeou turned her daown, an’ that made her sore. Ef
she’d bin mashed on ye, perhaps she’d done jest as she
did to git revenge fer bein’ turned daown.”</p>

<p>“No, something tells me this was more than a simple
case of mash,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” asked Havener.</p>

<p>“An attempt to bother me.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“Who knows? Haven’t I had enough troubles?”</p>

<p>“I should say so! But I thought your troubles of this
sort were over when you got rid of Lawrence. You left
two of the assistants who saw him try to fire the theater
to appear as witnesses against him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hardly think Lawrence was in this affair in
any way or manner. I confess I do not know just what
to make of it. Heretofore my enemies have been men,
but now there seems to be a woman in the case.”</p>

<p>“If this woman follows you, what will you do?”</p>

<p>“I shall endeavor to find out who she is, and bring
her to time, so she will drop the game.”</p>

<p>“See that you do,” advised Hodge. “And don’t be soft
with her because she is a woman.”</p>

<p>“Go look through the train and see if you can find the
woman you saw,” directed Frank. “If you find her, come
back here and tell me where she is.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” exclaimed Bart, getting up at once.</p>

<p>“That fellow is faithful to you,” said Havener, when
Bart had walked down the aisle; “but he is awfully disagreeable
at times. It’s nothing but his loyalty that makes
me take any stock in him.”</p>

<p>“His heart is in the right place,” asserted Merry.</p>

<p>“Nothing makes him doubt you. Why, I believe he
wanted to fight the whole company when you failed to
appear.”</p>

<p>“An’ he’s a fighter, b’gosh! when he gits started,”
declared Gallup. “I’ve seen him plunk some critters an’
he plunked them in great style.”</p>

<p>Hodge was gone some little time, but there was a grim
look of triumph when he returned.</p>

<p>“Find her?” asked Merry.</p>

<p>“Sure,” nodded Bart.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Last car. She did not get onto this one, but I rather
think she moved after you came on board. That makes
me all the more certain that it is the woman. She’s near
the rear end of the car, on the left side, as you go down
the aisle.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, rising, “I think I’ll go take a look
at her. Is she alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. And she cannot escape from the train
till it stops, if it should happen to be the right woman,
which I hope it is.”</p>

<p>Bart wished to accompany Frank to point the woman
out, but Merry objected.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “let me go alone.”</p>

<p>“I can show her to you.”</p>

<p>“If the woman I am looking for is in the car I’ll find
her.”</p>

<p>Merry passed slowly through the train, scanning each
passenger as he went along. He entered the last car. In
a few moments he would know if the mysterious veiled
woman really were on that train. If he found her, he
would be certain the strange encounter on the street had
a meaning that had not appeared on the surface.</p>

<p>The train was flying along swiftly, taking curves without
seeming to slacken speed in the least. Frank’s progress
through the car was rather slow, as the swaying
motion made it difficult for him to get along.</p>

<p>But when he had reached the rear of the car he was
filled with disappointment.</p>

<p>Not a sign of a veiled woman had he seen in the car.</p>

<p>More than that, there was no woman in black who resembled
the woman who had stopped him on the street
in Denver.</p>

<p>Could it be Hodge had been mistaken?</p>

<p>No! Something told him Bart had made no mistake
in the matter of seeing a woman who answered the
description given by Frank. He had said she was in the
last car. She was not there when Frank passed through
the car. Then she had moved.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Was the woman aware that she was being watched?
Had she moved to escape observation?</p>

<p>Frank stopped by the door at the rear end of the car.
He looked out through the glass in the door.</p>

<p>Some one was on the platform at one side of the door.
Frank opened the door and looked out.</p>

<p>The person on the platform was a woman in black,
and she wore a veil!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink19'>CHAPTER XIX.—ON THE REAR PLATFORM.</h2>

<p>A feeling of exultant satisfaction flashed over Merriwell,
and he quickly stepped out onto the platform, closing
the door behind him.</p>

<p>The woman turned and looked toward him.</p>

<p>The train was racing along, the track seeming to fly
away from beneath the last car.</p>

<p>It was a strange place for a woman to be, out there
on the rear platform, and Merry’s first thought had been
that it must be the woman he sought, for had she not
come out there to escape him? She had fancied he would
look through the car, fail to find her, and decide that she
was not on the train. It must be that she had seen Hodge
come in, and had realized at once why he had entered
the car. When he departed to carry the information to
Frank, the desperate woman had fled to the rear platform.</p>

<p>Immediately on stepping out onto the platform, however,
Frank decided that his reasoning was at fault.</p>

<p>It was a veiled woman, and she was in black, but it
was not the woman he sought. It was not the woman
who had caused his arrest in Denver!</p>

<p>Merry was disappointed.</p>

<p>The unknown looked at him, and said nothing. He
looked at her and wondered. The veil was thick and
baffling.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “this is a dangerous place.”</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>“You are liable to become dizzy out here and meet
with an accident,” he pursued. “If you should fall—well,
you know what that would mean. It is remarkable
that you should come out here.”</p>

<p>“The air,” she murmured, in a hoarse, husky voice.
“The car was stifling, and I needed the air. I felt ill in
there.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason why you should not come out
here,” declared Frank, solicitously. “You could have had
a window opened, and that would have given you air.”</p>

<p>“The window stuck.”</p>

<p>“It must be some of them would open. If you will
return, I’ll endeavor to find you a seat by an open window.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you,” she said, in the same peculiar,
husky voice. “Think I’ll stay out here. Don’t mind me.”</p>

<p>“Then I trust you will permit me to remain, and see
that you do not meet with any misfortune?”</p>

<p>“No. Go! Leave me! I had rather remain alone.”</p>

<p>She seemed like a middle-aged lady. He observed
that her clothes fitted her ill, and her hands were large
and awkward. She attempted to hide them.</p>

<p>All at once, with a suddenness that staggered him, the
truth burst on Frank.</p>

<p>The woman was no woman at all! It was a man
in disguise!</p>

<p>Merry literally gasped for a single instant, but he
recovered at once.</p>

<p>Through his head flashed a thought:</p>

<p>“This must be some criminal who is seeking to escape
justice!”</p>

<p>Immediately Frank resolved to remain on the platform
at any hazard. He would talk to the disguised unknown.</p>

<p>“The motion of the train is rather trying to one who
is not accustomed to it,” he said. “Some people feel it
quite as much as if they were on a vessel. Car sickness
and seasickness are practically the same thing.”</p>

<p>She looked at him through the concealing veil, but did
not speak.</p>

<p>“I have traveled considerable,” he pursued, “but, fortunately,
I have been troubled very little with sickness,
either on sea or land.”</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough to leave me!” came from
behind the veil, in accents of mingled imploration and
anger.</p>

<p>“I could not think of such a thing, madam!” he bowed,
as gallantly as possible. “It is my duty to remain and
see that you come to no harm.”</p>

<p>“I shall come to no harm. You are altogether too kind!
Your kindness is offensive!”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry you regard it thus, but I know my
duty.”</p>

<p>“If you knew half as much as you think, you would
go.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon; it is because I do know as much
as I think that I do not go.”</p>

<p>The unknown was losing patience.</p>

<p>“Go!” he commanded, and now his voice was masculine
enough to betray him, if Frank had not dropped
to the trick before.</p>

<p>“No,” smiled Merry, really beginning to enjoy it, “not
till you go in yourself, madam.”</p>

<p>The train lurched round a curve, causing the disguised
unknown to swing against the iron gate. Frank sprang
forward, as if to catch and save the person from going
over, but his real object was to apparently make a mistake
and snatch off the veil.</p>

<p>The man seemed to understand all this, for he warded
off Frank’s clutch, crying:</p>

<p>“I shall call for aid! I shall seek protection!”</p>

<p>“It would not be the first time to-day that a veiled
woman has done such a thing,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>The disguised man stared at him again. Merry fairly
itched to snatch away the veil.</p>

<p>“If you are seeking air, madam,” he suggested, “you
had better remove your veil. It must be very smothering,
for it seems to be quite thick.”</p>

<p>“You are far too anxious about me!” snapped the disguised
man. “I would advise you to mind your own business!”</p>

<p>This amused Merry still more. The situation was remarkably
agreeable to him.</p>

<p>“In some instances,” he said, politely, “your advice
would be worth taking, but an insane person should be
carefully watched, and that is why I am minding your
business just now.”</p>

<p>“An insane person?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that I am insane?”</p>

<p>“Well, I trust you will excuse me, but from your appearance
and your remarkable behavior, it seems to me
that you should be closely guarded.”</p>

<p>That seemed to make the unknown still more angry, but
it was plain he found difficulty in commanding words to
express himself.</p>

<p>“You’re a fool!” he finally snapped.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“You’re an idiot!”</p>

<p>“Thank you again.”</p>

<p>“You are the one who is crazy!”</p>

<p>“Still more thanks.”</p>

<p>“How have I acted to make you fancy me demented?”</p>

<p>“You are out here, and you may be contemplating self-destruction
by throwing yourself from this train.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that. I am contemplating nothing
of the sort.”</p>

<p>“But there are other evidences of your insanity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>As the disguised unknown did not speak, Merry went
on:</p>

<p>“The strongest evidence of your unbalanced state of
mind is the ill-chosen attire you are wearing.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why are you not dressed in the garments of your
sex?”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“You are not a woman,” declared Frank, coolly; “but
a man in the garments of a woman. Your disguise is altogether
too thin. It would not deceive anybody who
looked you over closely. You are——”</p>

<p>Frank got no further. With a cry of anger, the disguised
unknown sprang at him, grappled with him, panted
in his ear:</p>

<p>“You are altogether too sharp, Frank Merriwell! This
time you have overshot yourself! This ends you!”</p>

<p>Then he tried to fling Merry from the swiftly moving
train.</p>

<p>Frank instantly realized that it was to be a struggle for
life, and he met the assault as quickly and stiffly as he
could; but the disguised man seemed, of a truth, to have
the strength of an insane person. In his quick move, the
fellow had forced Frank back against the gate, and over
this, he tried to lift and hurl him.</p>

<p>“No you don’t!” came from Merry’s lips.</p>

<p>“Curse you!” panted the fellow. “I will do it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will—I don’t think!”</p>

<p>In the desperate struggle, both seemed to hang over
the gate for a moment. Then Frank slid back, securing a
firm grip, and felt safe.</p>

<p>Just then, however, the door of the car flew open, and
out sprang Hodge. Bart saw what was happening in a
moment, and he leaped to Merry’s aid.</p>

<p>Out on a high trestle that spanned a roaring, torrent-like
river rumbled the train.</p>

<p>Bart clutched Frank, gave the disguised man a shove,
and——</p>

<p>Just how it happened, neither of them could tell afterward,
but over the gate whirled the man, and down toward
the seething torrent he shot!</p>

<p>Up from that falling figure came a wild cry of horror
that was heard above the fumbling roar of the train on the
trestle bridge.</p>

<p>Over and over the figure turned, the skirts fluttering,
and then headlong it plunged into the white foam of the
torrent, disappearing from view.</p>

<p>On the rear platform of the last car two white-faced,
horrified young men had watched the terrible fall. They
stared down at the swirling river, looking for the unfortunate
wretch to reappear. Off the bridge flew the train,
and no longer were they able to see the river.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” came hoarsely from Bart.</p>

<p>“Then you saw—you knew it was a man?” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw his trousers beneath the skirts as I came
out the door.”</p>

<p>“This is terrible!” muttered Frank.</p>

<p>“He was trying to throw you over?”</p>

<p>“Yes; attempted to take me off my guard and hurl me
from the train.”</p>

<p>“Then the wretch has met a just fate,” declared Bart.</p>

<p>But now it seemed that the struggle on the platform
had been noticed by some one within the car. There were
excited faces at the glass in the door, and a trainman
came out, demanding:</p>

<p>“What is all this? Why are you out here? They tell
me a woman came out. Where is she?”</p>

<p>With unusual readiness, Bart quickly answered:</p>

<p>“She’s gone—jumped from the train.”</p>

<p>“Jumped?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We both tried to save her. Just as I reached the
door I saw my friend struggling to hold her, but she was
determined to fling herself over.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a fine piece of business!” came angrily
from the trainman. “What ailed her?”</p>

<p>“She must have been insane,” asserted Bart. “She attacked
my friend here, and then tried to jump off. He
could not hold her. I did not get hold of her in time.”</p>

<p>“What was he doing out here?”</p>

<p>“Watching her. You will admit it was rather queer for
a woman to come out here on the platform and stand. He
thought so, and so he came out to watch her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can both come in off this platform!”
growled the trainman, in anything but a civil manner.</p>

<p>They did so. The passengers swarmed round them
when they entered the car, literally flinging questions at
them.</p>

<p>“Who was the woman?”</p>

<p>“What ailed her?”</p>

<p>“Why did she go out there?”</p>

<p>“What did she do?”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it!”</p>

<p>Again Bart made the explanation, and then there arose
a babel.</p>

<p>“I noticed her,” declared one. “I saw she looked
queer.”</p>

<p>“I noticed her,” asserted another. “I saw she acted
queer.”</p>

<p>“I saw her when she went out,” put in a third, “and I
thought it was a crazy thing to do.”</p>

<p>“Without doubt the woman was insane,” declared a
pompous fat man.</p>

<p>“She must have been instantly killed.”</p>

<p>“She jumped into the river.”</p>

<p>“Then, she was drowned.”</p>

<p>“Who knows her?”</p>

<p>“She was all alone.”</p>

<p>Frank had been thinking swiftly all the while. He regretted
that Bart had been so hasty in making his explanation,
and now he resolved to tell as near the truth as
possible without contradicting Hodge.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen and ladies,” he said, “I have every reason
for believing that the person was a man.”</p>

<p>Then there were cries of astonishment and incredulity.</p>

<p>“A man?”</p>

<p>“Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous!”</p>

<p>But an elderly lady, who wore gold-bowed spectacles,
calmly said:</p>

<p>“The young gentleman is correct, I am quite sure. The
person in question sat directly in front of me, and I discovered
there was something wrong. I felt almost certain
it was a man before he got up and went out on the platform.”</p>

<p>Then there was excitement in the car. A perfect torrent
of questions was poured on Frank.</p>

<p>Merry explained that he had thought it rather remarkable
that a woman should be standing all alone on the rear
platform, and, after going out and speaking to the person,
he became convinced that it was a man in disguise. Then
he told how the man, on being accused, had attacked him
furiously, and finally had seemed to fling himself over
the iron gate.</p>

<p>It was a great sensation, but no one accused either
Merry or Bart of throwing the unknown over, not a little
to Frank’s relief.</p>

<p>At last, they got away and went forward into the car
where the company was gathered. Havener and Gallup
had been holding the double seat, and Frank and Bart sat
down there.</p>

<p>“Well, I fancy you failed to find the lady you were
looking for,” said Havener. “But what’s the matter?
You look as if something has happened.”</p>

<p>“Something has,” said Frank, grimly.</p>

<p>“Gol-darned ef I don’t b’lieve it!” exclaimed Ephraim.
“Both yeou an’ Hodge show it. Tell us abaout it.”</p>

<p>Frank did so in a very few words, astonishing both
Ephraim and the stage manager.</p>

<p>“Waal,” said the Vermonter, “the gal who tackled yeou
in Denver warn’t no man.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Frank, “and it is remarkable that
Hodge should have mistaken a man for such a woman
as I described.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t,” said Bart.</p>

<p>“But you have acknowledged that you believed this
was a man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this man was not the veiled woman I saw.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“Not much!”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Frank. “The mystery deepens!”</p>

<p>“Did you mistake this person for the veiled woman I
meant?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“And did not find another?”</p>

<p>“Not a sign of one. I do not believe there is another
on the train.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a mystery!” confessed Hodge. “I saw
nothing of the one I meant when I went to look for you.”</p>

<p>“It must be you saw no one but that man in the first
place.”</p>

<p>Bart shook his head, flushing somewhat.</p>

<p>“Do you think I would take that man for a woman
with a perfect figure, such as you described? What in the
world do you fancy is the matter with my eyes?”</p>

<p>“By gum!” drawled Gallup. “This air business is
gittin’ too thick fer me. I don’t like so much mystery a
bit.”</p>

<p>“If that man was not the one you meant, Hodge,” said
Merry, “then the mysterious woman is still on this train.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” nodded Bart.</p>

<p>“Find her,” urged Frank. “I want to get my eyes on
her more than ever. Surely you should be able to find
her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” cried Bart, jumping up.</p>

<p>Away he went.</p>

<p>Frank remained with Havener and Gallup, talking over
the exciting and thrilling adventure and the mystery of it
all till Hodge returned. At a glance Merry saw that his
college friend had not been successful.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “did you find her?”</p>

<p>“No,” confessed Bart, looking crestfallen. “I went
through the entire train, and I looked every passenger
over. The woman I meant is not on this train.”</p>

<p>“Then, it must be that your woman was the man who
met his death in the river. There is no other explanation
of her disappearance. You must give up now, Hodge.”</p>

<p>But Hodge would not give up, although he could offer
no explanation, and the mystery remained unsolved.</p>

<p>There were numerous stops between Denver and Puelbo,
and it was nightfall before the train brought them
to their destination. The sun had dropped behind the distant
Rockies, and the soft shades of a perfect spring evening
were gathering when they drew up at the station in
Puelbo.</p>

<p>Lights were beginning to twinkle in windows, and the
streets were lighted. “Props” had gone to look after
the baggage, and the company was gathered on the platform.
Cabmen were seeking to attract fares.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, a cry broke from the lips of Bart Hodge:</p>

<p>“There she is!”</p>

<p>All were startled by his sudden cry. They saw him
start from the others, pointing toward a woman who was
speaking to a cabman. That woman had left the train and
crossed the platform, and she was dressed in black and
heavily veiled.</p>

<p>Frank saw her—recognized her.</p>

<p>“By heavens! it is the woman,” he exclaimed.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink20'>CHAPTER XX.—MAN OR WOMAN.</h2>

<p>Into the cab sprang the woman. Slam! the door closed
behind her. Crack!—the whip of the driver fell on the
horses, and away went the cab.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted Hodge.</p>

<p>Cabby did not heed the command.</p>

<p>Frank made a rush for another cab.</p>

<p>“Follow!” he cried, pointing toward the disappearing
vehicle. “I will give you five dollars—ten dollars—if you
do not lose sight of that cab!”</p>

<p>“In!” shouted the driver. “I’ll earn that ten!”</p>

<p>In Frank plunged, jerking the door to behind him. The
cab whirled from the platform with a jerk. Away it flew.</p>

<p>“It will be worth twenty dollars to get a peep beneath
that veil!” muttered Frank Merriwell.</p>

<p>The windows were open. He looked out on one side.
He could see nothing of the cab they were pursuing.
Back he dodged, and out he popped his head on the
other side.</p>

<p>“There it is!”</p>

<p>He felt that he was not mistaken. The fugitive cab was
turning a corner at that moment. They were after it
closely.</p>

<p>Frank wondered where the woman could have been
hidden on the train so that she had escaped observation.
He decided that she must have been in one of the toilet
rooms.</p>

<p>But what about the veiled man who was disguised as
a woman? That man had known Frank—had spoken his
name.</p>

<p>It was a double mystery.</p>

<p>The pursuit of the cab continued some distance. At
last the cab in advance drew up in front of a hotel, and a
man got out!</p>

<p>Merriwell had leaped to the ground, and cabby was
down quite as swiftly, saying:</p>

<p>“There, sir, I followed ’em. Ten plunks, please.”</p>

<p>The door of the other cab had been closed, and the
man was paying the driver. He wore no overcoat, and
carried no baggage.</p>

<p>“Fooled!” exclaimed Frank, in disappointment. “You
have followed the wrong cab, driver!”</p>

<p>“I followed the one you told me to follow,” declared
the driver.</p>

<p>“No; you made a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t try that game on me!” growled the man.
“It’s your way of attempting to get out of paying the
tenner you promised.”</p>

<p>“No; I shall pay you, for you did the best you could.
It was not your fault that you made a mistake in the mass
of carriages at the depot.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t make no mistake,” asserted the cabby, sullenly.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s useless to argue over it,” said Merry, as he
gave the man the promised ten dollars. “I am sure you
made a mistake.“</p>

<p>“Think I couldn’t follow Bill Dover and his spotted
nigh hawse?” exploded the driver. “I couldn’t have missed
that hawse if I’d tried.”</p>

<p>Frank saw one of the horses attached to the other cab
was spotted. He had noticed that peculiarity about one
of the horses attached to the cab the mysterious woman
had entered.</p>

<p>“It’s the same horse!” exclaimed Merry.</p>

<p>“’Course it is,” nodded the driver.</p>

<p>The man had paid his fare and was carelessly sauntering
into the hotel. As he disappeared through the door-way,
Frank sprang to the door of the other cab, flung it
wide open, and looked in, more than half expecting to
discover the woman still inside.</p>

<p>No woman was there!</p>

<p>Frank caught his breath in astonishment, and stood
there, staring into the empty cab.</p>

<p>“Hi, there! wot cher doin’?” called the man on the box.</p>

<p>Frank did not answer. He reached into the cab and felt
on the floor. He found something, brought it forth,
looked at it amazed.</p>

<p>It was a woman’s dress!</p>

<p>But where was the woman?</p>

<p>Garment after garment Frank lifted, discovering that
all a woman’s outer wearing apparel lay on the floor of
that cab.</p>

<p>“Vanished!” he muttered. “Disappeared—gone? What
does it mean?”</p>

<p>Then he thought of the man who had left the cab and
entered the hotel, and he almost reeled.</p>

<p>“That was the woman!”</p>

<p>He had seen one woman change into a man on the
train, and here was another and no less startling metamorphosis.</p>

<p>“Driver,” he cried, “didn’t you take a person on in
woman’s clothes at the station and let one off in man’s
clothes just now?”</p>

<p>“None of yer business!” came the coarse reply. “I
knows enough not ter answer questions when I’m paid ter
keep still.”</p>

<p>That was quite enough; the driver might as well have
answered, for he had satisfied Merriwell.</p>

<p>Frank was astonished by the remarkable change that
the woman had made while within the cab, but now he
believed he understood why she had not been detected
while on the train. She had been able to make a change
of disguises in the toilet room, and had passed herself off
as a man. Hodge had looked for a veiled woman, and he
had looked for a veiled woman; it was not strange that
both of them had failed to notice a person in masculine
attire who must have looked like a woman.</p>

<p>Up the hotel steps Frank leaped. He entered the office,
he searched and inquired. At last, he found out that a
beardless man had entered by the front door, but had
simply passed through and left by a side door.</p>

<p>“Given me the slip,” decided Frank. He realized that
he had encountered a remarkably clever woman.</p>

<p>And the mystery was deeper than ever.</p>

<p>Frank went to the hotel at which the company was to
stop, and found all save Wynne had arrived. Hodge was
on the watch for Merry, and eagerly inquired concerning
his success in following the woman. Frank explained
how he had been tricked.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s plain this unknown female is mighty slippery,”
said Bart. “You have not seen the last of her.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid there are some things about this double
mystery which will never be solved,” admitted Frank.
“For instance, the identity of the man who fell into the
river.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be dead lucky if we do not have trouble over
that affair,” said Hodge.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Some fool is liable to swear out a warrant charging
us with throwing the unknown overboard.”</p>

<p>“I thought of that,” nodded Frank, “and that is why I
took occasion on the train to straighten out your story
somewhat. It is always best, Bart, to stick to the straight
truth.”</p>

<p>Hodge flushed and looked resentful, but plainly sought
to repress his feelings, as he said:</p>

<p>“I am not the only person in the world who believes the
truth should not be spoken at all times.”</p>

<p>“If one cannot speak the truth,” said Merry, quietly, “he
had better remain silent and say nothing at all, particularly
in a case like this. There is an old saying that ‘the
truth can afford to travel slowly, but a lie must be on the
jump all the time, or it will get caught.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think this is any time to moralize,” came
a bit sharply from Bart. “If we were to go into an argument,
I rather think I could show logically that a white
lie is sometimes more commendable than the truth.”</p>

<p>“In shielding another, possibly,” admitted Merry; “but
never in shielding the one who tells it. The more a person
lies, the more he has to lie, for it becomes necessary to
tell one falsehood to cover up another, and, after a while,
the unfortunate individual finds himself so ensnared in a
network of fabrications that it is impossible for him to
clear himself. Then disaster comes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t preach!” snapped Bart. “Let’s go to your
room and talk this matter of the veiled woman over.
There is trouble brewing for you, and you must be prepared
to meet it. Havener has registered for the company,
and all you have to do is call for your key.”</p>

<p>So Frank and Bart went to the room of the former.</p>

<p>Puelbo had been well “papered.” The work was done
thoroughly, and every board, every dead wall, and every
available window flaunted the paper of “True Blue.”</p>

<p>The failure of “For Old Eli” was still fresh in the minds
of the people of the city, but neither had they forgotten
Frank Merriwell’s plucky promise to bring the play back
to that place and perform it successfully there.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the place had given him their support,
but Frank was determined that extracts from the
notices in the Denver papers should reach the eyes of those
who did not read the Puelbo papers closely. With this
end in view, he had the extracts printed on flyers, as small
bills are called, and the flyers were headed in startling
type:</p>

<p class='center' style='margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>“Five Hundred Dollars Fine!”</p>

<p>To this he added:</p>

<table style='margin:auto' summary=''>
<tr><td>
“Each and every person who reads the following clippings<br/>
from Denver newspapers will be fined Five Hundred Dollars!”<br/>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It is needless to say that nearly every one who could
read was careful to read the clippings through to the end.</p>

<p>This manner of attracting attention was effective, even
though it may seem rather boyish in its conception.</p>

<p>His printing was done on the very night that he arrived
in Puelbo, and the flyers were scattered broadcast the following
day.</p>

<p>He obtained the names of a large number of prominent
citizens, to whom he sent complimentary tickets, good for
the first night’s performance.</p>

<p>Frank was determined to have a house, even if it was
made up principally of deadheads.</p>

<p>On the occasion of his former visit to Puelbo he had
received some free advertising through Leslie Lawrence,
who had circulated printed accusations against him. He
scarcely expected anything of the sort on this occasion,
and he was rather startled when, on the morning following
his arrival, he discovered that a circular had been scattered
broadcast, which seemed to be even more malicious
than the former attempt upon him.</p>

<p>In this circular he was plainly charged with the murder
of an unknown woman shortly after leaving Denver, and
it was said he had been aided in the crime by Bartley
Hodge.</p>

<p>Frank was calmly reading this bold accusation when
Hodge came bursting into the room in a manner that
reminded Merry of his entrance under similar circumstances
on the former occasion.</p>

<p>Seeing the paper in Merry’s hand, Bart hoarsely cried:</p>

<p>“So you’ve got it! Then you know about it! Well,
now, sir, what do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Sit down, Hodge,” said Frank, calmly. “You seem all
out of breath. You are excited.”</p>

<p>“Excited!” shouted the dark-faced youth. “Well, isn’t
that enough to excite a man of stone!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean this?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that! What in the name of creation do you suppose
I meant?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t certain.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t cert—— Oh, say; that’s too much! What
do you think? What are you made of, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Now, my dear fellow, you must stop going on like this.
You’ll bring on heart disease if you keep it up.”</p>

<p>Hodge dropped down on a chair and stared at Merry.</p>

<p>“Well—I’ll—be—blowed!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“You are nearly blowed now,” said Frank. “You
seem quite out of breath.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible you have read that paper you hold in
your hand?” asked Bart, with forced calmness.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have read it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do not understand you yet! I thought I did,
but I’m willing to confess that I don’t.”</p>

<p>Then he jumped up, almost shouting:</p>

<p>“Why, man alive, don’t you understand that we are
charged with murder—with murder?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank, still unruffled, “it seems so by this.”</p>

<p>“And you take it like that!”</p>

<p>“What is the use to take it differently?”</p>

<p>“Use? Use? Sometimes I think you haven’t a drop
of good, hot blood in your body.”</p>

<p>“If a person has plenty of good, hot blood, it is a good
thing for him to cool it off with good, cool brains. Hot
blood is all right, but it should be controlled; it should not
control the man.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can talk that way, under such circumstances.
Why, we may be arrested for murder any
moment!”</p>

<p>“We shall not.”</p>

<p>“Shall not?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because our unknown enemy does not dare come out
into the open and make the charge against us.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p>“This.”</p>

<p>Frank held up the accusing paper.</p>

<p>“That?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why should that make you think so?”</p>

<p>“If our enemy had intended to come out and make the
charge against us openly, this would not have appeared.
It is simply an attempt to hurt us from under cover, or to
arouse others against us—against me, in particular.”</p>

<p>Bart could see there was logic in Merry’s reasoning, but
still he was fearful of what might happen.</p>

<p>“Well, even you must acknowledge that the unknown
enemy may succeed in his purpose,” said Hodge. “There
were a number of persons who saw something of the
struggle on the train. This may arouse some of them, or
one of them, at least, to do something.”</p>

<p>“It may.”</p>

<p>“You confess that?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t think you would.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it will. Hodge, I have a fancy that, in
this case, same as in the other, my enemy will overshoot
the mark.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Something tells me that this warning, intended to turn
suspicion against me, will serve as an advertisement. Of
course, it will be a most unpleasant notoriety to have, but
it may serve to bring people out to see me.”</p>

<p>Bart looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” he confessed, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“I had far rather not had the notoriety,” admitted
Frank; “but that can’t be helped now. Let the people turn
out to see ‘True Blue.’ Perhaps I’ll get a chance at my
enemy later.”</p>

<p>“The veiled woman——”</p>

<p>“Is in it, I fancy. I believe there was some connection
between the veiled woman and the veiled man—the one
who plunged from the train into the river.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that, but I’ve been unable to figure
out what the connection could be. Why was the man
veiled and disguised thus?”</p>

<p>“So that I would not recognize him.”</p>

<p>“Then, it must be that you would know him if you saw
him face to face.”</p>

<p>“As he knew me. He called me by name as he sprang
upon me.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s done for, but I believe the woman will
prove the most dangerous. Something tells me she was
the real mover in this business.”</p>

<p>“I fancy you are right, Hodge. At first, in Denver, I
thought she had been piqued by the manner in which I
replied to her, but since all these strange things have
happened, I know it was more than a case of pique.”</p>

<p>“When you make a woman your enemy, she is far more
dangerous than a man, for women are more reckless—less
fearful of consequences.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” nodded Frank. “Women know they
will not be punished to the full extent of the law, no
matter what they do. Juries are easily hypnotized by pretty
women. Where a woman and a man are connected in
committing a crime, and the woman is shown to be the
prime mover, a jury will let the woman off as easily as
possible. A jury always hesitates about condemning a
woman to death, no matter if she has committed a most
fiendish murder. In the East, women adventuresses ply
their nefarious arts and work upon the sympathies of the
juries so that, when called to the bar, they are almost always
acquitted. It is remarkable that men should be so
soft. It is not gallantry; it is softness. The very man
who would cry the loudest if he had been hit by an adventuress
is the most eager to acquit the woman in case
he happens to be on the jury to pronounce the verdict in
her case.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Hodge, “you are sound and level in that
statement, Frank. It’s plain you do not think true chivalry
consists of acquitting female blackmailers and assassins.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let this little attempt to injure us frighten you,
Hodge,” advised Frank, rising. “I think it will miscarry
entirely. We’ve got plenty of work for to-day, and to-night
I believe I shall be able to tell beyond a doubt
whether ‘True Blue’ is a success or a failure. I think the
test will come right here in Puelbo, where we met disaster
before.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink21'>CHAPTER XXI.—GALLUP MEETS THE MYSTERIOUS WOMAN.</h2>

<p>The mechanical arrangements and special scenery had
arrived and were moved into the theater. Supers had
been engaged to attend rehearsal in the afternoon, so that
they might know their business when evening came.</p>

<p>Frank attended to the details of much of the work of
making ready, although he had full confidence in Havener
and Hodge, who assisted him. He saw that the mechanical
effect representing the boat race was put up and
tested, making sure it worked perfectly. He was anxious
about this, for any hitch in that scene was certain to
ruin the whole play.</p>

<p>Gallup proved valuable. He worked about the stage,
and he was of great assistance to Havener, who wished
Merriwell to appoint him assistant stage manager.</p>

<p>Of course, everybody was anxious about the result, but
the majority of the company had confidence in Merriwell
and his play. Cassie Lee, perhaps, was the only one who
was never assailed by a doubt concerning the outcome.</p>

<p>“I shall do my best to-night—at any cost,” she told
Frank.</p>

<p>At that moment he did not pause to consider the real
meaning of her words. Afterward he knew what she
meant. She still carried a tiny needle syringe and a phial
that contained a certain dangerous drug that had so nearly
wrought her ruin.</p>

<p>The various members of the company drifted into
the theater by the stage entrance, looked over their
dressing rooms and the stage and drifted out again. They had
been engaged to act, and they did not propose to work
when it was not necessary.</p>

<p>Gallup whistled as he hustled about the work Havener
directed him to do. He made his long legs carry him
about swiftly, although he sometimes tripped over his own
feet.</p>

<p>Ephraim was arranging a mass of scenery so that every
piece would be handy for use that night when the time
came to use it. While doing this, he was surprised to see
one of the dressing-room doors cautiously open and a person
peer out.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” exclaimed the Vermonter, stepping back out
of sight. “Who’s that?”</p>

<p>Again the person peered out of the dressing room, as if
to make sure the coast was clear.</p>

<p>“I must be dreamin’!” thought the Vermont youth, rubbing
his eyes. “I’ve got ’em jest from hearin’ Frank and
Hodge talk so much about her.”</p>

<p>A moment later he changed his mind.</p>

<p>“No, by ginger!” he hissed, as the person slipped out of
the dressing room. “It’s her!”</p>

<p>It was “her,” and that means that it was the mysterious
veiled woman!</p>

<p>Recovering instantly from the shock of his surprise,
Gallup sprang out from behind the scenery and made a
rush for the unknown.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” he cried. “B’gosh! yeou’ve gotter give a
’count of yerself, an’ don’t yeou fergit it!”</p>

<p>She started, turned on him, dodged. He flung out his
hand and clutched at her, catching hold of the chain that
encircled her neck and suspended her purse.</p>

<p>“I want yeou!” palpitated the Yankee youth. “Yeou’re
jest the——”</p>

<p>Flirt!—the woman made a quick motion toward him.
Something struck Ephraim in his eyes, burning like fire.
He was nearly knocked down by the shock, and a yell of
pain escaped his lips.</p>

<p>“I’m blinded!” he groaned.</p>

<p>It was true; he could not see.</p>

<p>With something like a scornful laugh, the woman flitted
away and disappeared, leaving poor Ephraim bellowing
with pain and clawing at his eyes, as if he would dig them
out of his head.</p>

<p>“Murder!” he howled. “Oh, I’m dyin’! Somebody
come quick! My eyes hev been put aout! Oh, wow-wow!
Oh, I wisht I’d staid to hum on the farm!”</p>

<p>Down on the floor he fell, and over and over he rolled
in the greatest agony.</p>

<p>Havener and some of the regular theater hands heard
his wild cries and came rushing to the spot. They found
him on the floor, kicking and thrashing about.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” demanded the stage manager.</p>

<p>Gallup did not hear him.</p>

<p>“I’m dyin’!” he blubbered. “Oh, it’s an awful way ter
die! My eyes are gone! Ow-yow!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” Havener again cried, getting
hold of the thrashing youth. “What has happened?”</p>

<p>“Stop her!” roared Ephraim, realizing that some person
had come and thinking instantly that the woman
must be detained. “Don’t let her git erway!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let who get away?”</p>

<p>“The woman! Ow-wow! Bring a pail of warter an’
let me git my head inter it! I must do somethin’ ter put
aout the fire! Oh, my eyes! my eyes!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter with your eyes?”</p>

<p>“She threw somethin’ inter ’em.”</p>

<p>“She?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The woman.”</p>

<p>“What woman?”</p>

<p>“The veiled woman—the one that has made all the
trouble fer Merry! Oh, this is jest awful!”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” demanded Havener, impatiently.
“There is no veiled woman here! Have you
lost your senses?”</p>

<p>Then, realizing that they were doing nothing to prevent
her from making her escape, Gallup sat up and howled:</p>

<p>“She was here! I saw her comin’ aout of a dressin’
room. Oh, dear! Yow! I tried to ketch her! Oh, my
eyes! She flung somethin’ inter my face an’ put both my
eyes out!”</p>

<p>“Something has been thrown into his eyes!” exclaimed
Havener. “It’s red pepper! He is telling the truth!
Somebody get some water! Somebody run to a drug
store and get something for him to use on his eyes!”</p>

<p>“Darn it all!” shouted Gallup. “Let me die, ef I’ve gotter!
but don’t let that infarnal woman git erway!”</p>

<p>“I will try to see to that,” said Havener, rushing away.</p>

<p>He dashed down to the stage door, but he was too late,
for the doorkeeper told him the veiled woman had
gone out.</p>

<p>“Why in the world did you let her in?” angrily demanded
the irate stage manager.</p>

<p>“She said she belonged to the company.”</p>

<p>“She lied! She has half killed one of the company!”</p>

<p>“I heard the shouts,” said the doorkeeper, “and I
thought somebody was hurt. But it wasn’t my fault.”</p>

<p>“If she tries to come in here again, seize and hold her.
I’ll give you five dollars if you hold her till I can reach
her! She is a female tiger!”</p>

<p>Then Havener rushed back to see what could be done
for Gallup.</p>

<p>Groaning and crying, Gallup was washing the pepper
from his eyes, which were fearfully inflamed and swollen.
He could not see Havener, but heard his voice, and eagerly
asked:</p>

<p>“Did ye ketch the dratted critter?”</p>

<p>“No; she got out before I reached the door.”</p>

<p>“Darn her!” grated Ephraim. “I say darn her! Never
said ennything as bad as that about a female woman before,
but I jest can’t help it this time! I won’t be able to
see fer a week!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will,” assured Havener. “But I rather
think your eyes will look bad for some time to come.”</p>

<p>“Here is something he had in his hand,” said one of
the supers. “It’s her purse, I reckon; but there ain’t no
money in it.”</p>

<p>Havener took it.</p>

<p>“Are you sure there wasn’t any money in it when you
examined it?” he asked, sharply.</p>

<p>The super seemed to feel insulted, and he angrily protested
that he would not have touched a cent if there had
been five hundred dollars in it.</p>

<p>“But I notice you had curiosity enough to examine the
contents of it,” came dryly from the stage manager. “I’ll
just keep this. It may prove to be a valuable clew to the
woman’s identity.”</p>

<p>Everything possible was done for Ephraim’s eyes, but it
was a long time before he was much relieved from the
agony he was suffering. Then he was taken to the hotel,
with a bandage over his eyes, and a doctor came to attend
him.</p>

<p>The physician said he would do everything possible to
get Ephraim into shape to play that evening, but he did
not give a positive assurance that he would be able to do
so. As soon as Frank heard of the misfortune which had
befallen the Vermont youth, he hastened to the hotel and
to the room where Ephraim was lying on the bed.</p>

<p>Gallup heard his step and recognized it when he entered.</p>

<p>“I’m slappin’ glad yeou’ve come, Frank!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“And I am terribly sorry you have met with such a misfortune,
Ephraim,” declared Merry.</p>

<p>“So be I, Frank—so be I! But I’m goin’ ter play my
part ter-night ur bu’st my galluses tryin’! I ain’t goin’
to knock aout the show ef I kin help it.”</p>

<p>“That was not what I meant. I was sorry because of
the pain you must have suffered.”</p>

<p>“Waal, it was ruther tough,” the faithful country lad
confessed. “By gum! it was jest as ef somebody’d chucked
a hull lot of coals right inter my lookers. It jest knocked
me silly, same ez if I’d bin hit with a club.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen? Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>Ephraim told the story of his adventure, finishing with:</p>

<p>“I kainder guess that red pepper warn’t meant fer me,
Frank. That was meant fer yeou. That woman was in
there ter fix yeou so yeou couldn’t play ter-night.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite likely you may be right, Ephraim; but she
had to give it to you in order to escape. But where is this
purse you snatched from her?”</p>

<p>“On the stand, there. Havener tuck possession of it,
but I got him to leave it here, so yeou might see it right
away when yeou came.”</p>

<p>Frank found the purse and opened it. From it he drew
forth a crumpled and torn telegram. Smoothing this out,
he saw it was dated at Castle Rock the previous day. It
read as follows:</p>

<div class='bq'>
<p>“<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Mrs. Hayward Grace</span>, Puelbo, Colo.</p>

<p>“All right. Close call. Fell from train into river. Came
near drowning, but managed to swim out. Will be along
on first train to-morrow. Keep track of the game.</p>

<p style='text-align:right; margin:0 0ex 0 auto'>“P. F.”</p>
</div>

<p>Frank jumped when he read that.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Whut is it?” Ephraim eagerly asked.</p>

<p>“I believe I understand this.”</p>

<p>“Do ye?”</p>

<p>“Sure! This was from the man who fell from the
train into the river—the man disguised as a woman, who
attacked me on the rear platform!”</p>

<p>“Looks zif yeou might be right.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it! The fellow escaped with his life! It
is marvelous!”</p>

<p>“I sh’u’d say so!”</p>

<p>“He dispatched his accomplice, the woman, to let her
know that he was living.”</p>

<p>“Yeou’ve struck it, Frank!”</p>

<p>“And she was the one who got out the accusing flyers,
charging me with the crime of murder!”</p>

<p>“I bet!”</p>

<p>“The man is in this city now, and they are working together
again.”</p>

<p>“I dunno’d I see whut they’re goin’ to make aout of it,
but mebbe yeou do.”</p>

<p>“Not yet. They must be enemies I have made.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Mrs. Hayward Grace?”</p>

<p>“Never heard the name before.”</p>

<p>“Waal, he didn’t sign his name Hayward Grace, so it
seems he ain’t her husband; don’t it, Frank?”</p>

<p>“He signed ‘P. F.’ Now, I wonder what one of my
enemies can be fitted to those initials?”</p>

<p>“I dunno.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I. But this telegram has given me a feeling
of relief, for I am glad to know the man was not
drowned.”</p>

<p>“Drownin’s too good fer him! He oughter be hung!”</p>

<p>“Although my conscience was clear in the matter, I am
glad to know that I was in no way connected with his
death. Hodge will not be so pleased, for he will not stop
to reason that the chances of a charge of murder being
brought against us are about blotted out. Ephraim, I am
very sorry you were hurt, but I’m extremely glad you
snatched this purse and brought me this telegram. I shall
take care of it. I shall use it to trace my enemies, if
possible.”</p>

<p>“Waal, I’m glad I done somethin’, though I’d bin a ’tarnal
sight gladder if I hed ketched that woman.”</p>

<p>Frank carefully placed the purse and the telegram in his
pocket, where he knew it would be safe.</p>

<p>Assuring Ephraim that everything possible should be
done for him, he hastened out.</p>

<p>That afternoon the rehearsal took place, with another
person reading Ephraim’s part. It was feared that Gallup
would not be able to see to play when it came night, but
Frank hoped that he could, and the Vermont youth vowed
he’d do it some way.</p>

<p>The rehearsal passed off fairly well, although there
were some hitches. Havener looked satisfied.</p>

<p>“I’d rather it would go off this way than to have it go
perfectly smooth,” he declared. “I’ve noticed it almost always
happens that a good, smooth rehearsal just before a
first performance means that the performance will go bad,
and vice versa.”</p>

<p>Frank had not been long in the business, but he, also,
had observed that it often happened as Havener had
said.</p>

<p>The theater orchestra rehearsed with them, getting all
the “cue music” arranged, and having everything in readiness
for the specialties.</p>

<p>The night came at last, and the company gathered at
the theater, wondering what the outcome would be.</p>

<p>Gallup was on hand, but he still had the bandage over
his eyes. He was wearing it up to the last minute, so that
he would give them as much rest as possible.</p>

<p>“Somebody’ll hev ter make me up ter-night,” he said.
“I don’t believe I kin see well enough ter do that.”</p>

<p>Havener agreed to look after that.</p>

<p>While the various members were putting the finishing
touches on their toilet and make-up, word came that people
were pouring into the theater in a most satisfactory manner.
The orchestra tuned up for the overture.</p>

<p>Frank went round to see that everybody was prepared.
He had fallen into that habit, not feeling like depending
on some one else to do it.</p>

<p>Most of the men were entirely ready. A few were making
the last touches. Stella Stanley and Agnes Kirk were
all ready to go on.</p>

<p>“Where is Cassie?” asked Merry.</p>

<p>“In the dressing room,” said Stella. “She told us not
to wait for her. Said she would be right out.”</p>

<p>Frank went to the dressing room. The door was slightly
open, and, through the opening, he saw Cassie. She had
thrust back the sleeve of her left arm, and he saw a
tiny instrument in her right hand. He knew in a twinkling
what she was about to do.</p>

<p>With a leap, Frank went into that room and caught
her by the wrist.</p>

<p>“Cassie!” he cried, guardedly. “You told me you had
given it up! You told me you’d never use morphine
again!”</p>

<p>“Frank!” she whispered, looking abashed. “I know I
told you so! I meant it, but I must use it just once more—just
to-night. I am not feeling at my best. I’m dull
and heavy. You know how much depends on me. If I
don’t do well I shall ruin everything. It won’t hurt me
to use it just this once. The success of ‘True Blue’ may
depend on it!”</p>

<p>“If the success of ‘True Blue’ depended on it beyond
the shadow of a doubt, I would not let you use it, Cassie!
Great heavens! girl, you are mad! If you fall again into
the clutches of that fiend nothing can save you!”</p>

<p>“But the play——”</p>

<p>“Do you think I would win success with my play at the
price of your soul! No, Cassie Lee! If I knew it meant
failure I would forbid you to use the stuff in that syringe.
Here, give it to me!”</p>

<p>He took it from her and put it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “it is out of your reach. You must
play without it. There goes the overture. The curtain
will go up in a few minutes. All I ask of you is to do your
best, Cassie, let it mean success or failure.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink22'>CHAPTER XXII.—THE END OF THE ROPE.</h2>

<p>The theater was packed. Under no circumstances had
Frank anticipated such an audience on the opening night.
He felt sure that the advertising given him through the
effort of his enemies to injure him had done much to bring
people out. Another thing had brought them there. Curiosity
led many of them to the theater. They remembered
Merriwell’s first appearance in Puelbo and its outcome,
and they had not forgotten how, in a speech from the
stage, he had vowed that he would bring the play back
there and give a successful performance. He had rewritten
the piece, and it had been played in Denver to an
invited audience, every member of which went away
highly pleased. The Denver papers had pronounced in
favor of it.</p>

<p>Puelbo people admired pluck and determination. They
could not help feeling admiration for the dogged persistency
of Frank Merriwell. And they really hoped he would
make good his promise to give a successful performance.</p>

<p>Frank’s first entrance was carefully worked up to in the
play, and he was astounded when he came laughing and
singing onto the stage, to be greeted by a perfect whirlwind
of applause. Nor did the applause cease till he had
recognized it by bowing.</p>

<p>Then, as everything quieted down and the play was
about to move on again, there came a terrible cry that rang
through the house:</p>

<p>“Fire!”</p>

<p>Frank understood in a twinkling that it was a false
alarm, given for the purpose of producing a stampede and
raising the performance.</p>

<p>After that cry for a moment everybody sat as if turned
to stone. It was the calm before the panic.</p>

<p>Then Frank’s voice rang out clear as a bell:</p>

<p>“There is no fire! Keep your seats!”</p>

<p>Some had sprung up, but his clear voice reached every
part of the house, and it checked the movement.</p>

<p>“Fire! fire!”</p>

<p>Shrill and piercing was the cry, in the voice of a woman.</p>

<p>“Arrest that woman!” cried Frank. “She is trying to
ruin this performance! She is the one who circulated a
lying and malicious circular charging me with the crime of
murder. It was a part of a plot to ruin me!”</p>

<p>Frank confessed afterward that he did not understand
why the audience remained without stampeding after that
second alarm. It must have been that there was a magic
something in his voice and manner that convinced them
and held them. At any rate, there was no rush for the
doors.</p>

<p>All at once there was a commotion in the first balcony,
from which the cries had come. Two policemen had
seized a man and a woman, and the arrested pair were
taken from the theater.</p>

<p>Quiet was restored, and Frank made a few soothing remarks
to the audience, after which the play proceeded.</p>

<p>And now he had the sympathy of every person in the
great audience. When an actor has once fairly won the
sympathy of his audience, he is almost sure of success.</p>

<p>The first act went off beautifully. The storm and shipwreck
at the close of the act took with the spectators.
There was hearty applause when the curtain fell.</p>

<p>Frank had arranged that things should be rushed in
making ready for the second act. He wanted no long
waits between acts, for long waits weary the patience of
the best audiences.</p>

<p>The second act seemed to go even better than the first,
if such a thing were possible. The singing of the “Yale
Quartet” proved a great hit, and they were obliged to
respond to encore after encore. Cassie’s dancing and singing
were well appreciated, and Frank, who was watching
her, decided that she could not have done better under any
circumstances. He did not know how hard she was
working for success. He did not know that she had actually
prayed that she might do better than she had ever
done before in all her life.</p>

<p>The discomfiture of <i>Spike Dubad</i> at the close of the
second act was relished by all.</p>

<p>At last the curtain rose on the third act, round which
the whole plot of the play revolved. Now, the interest of
the audience was keyed up to the right pitch, and the
anxiety of the actors was intense.</p>

<p>The first scene went off all right, and then came the
change to the scene where the boat race was shown on the
river. Everything worked perfectly, and there was a tumult
in that theater when the stage suddenly grew dark,
just as the Yale boat was seen to forge into the lead.</p>

<p>And then, in a few moments, the distant sounds of
cheering and the screaming of steam whistles seemed to
burst out close at hand, filling the theater with an uproar
of sound. Then up flashed the lights, and the open boathouse
was shown, with the river beyond. The boats
flashed in at the finish, the Yale cheer drowned everything
else, and Frank Merriwell was brought onto the stage in
the arms of his college friends.</p>

<p>The curtain came down, but the audience was standing
and cheering like mad, as if it had just witnessed the
success of its favorite in a real college race. The curtain
went up for the tableau again and again, but that audience
would not be satisfied till Frank Merriwell came out and
said something.</p>

<p>Frank came at last, and such an ovation as he received
it brought a happy mist to his eyes.</p>

<p>“There he is!” somebody cried. “He said he would
come back here with his play and do the trick!”</p>

<p>“Well, he has done it!” cried another. “And he is the
real Frank Merriwell, who has shown us the kind of
never-say-die pluck that has made Yale famous the world
over. Three cheers for Frank Merriwell!”</p>

<p>They were given. Then all Frank could say was a few
choking words:</p>

<p>“My friends, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!
You cannot know how much was depending on the success
or failure of this play. Perhaps all my future career
depended on it. I vowed I would win——”</p>

<p>“And you have!” shouted a voice.</p>

<p>“It seems so. Again, I thank you. I am too happy to
say more. Words are idle now.”</p>

<p>He retired.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Frank Merriwell had won with his play; “True Blue”
was a success. In his happiness he forgot his enemies,
he forgot that two persons had been arrested in the balcony.
It was not till the next morning when he was invited
by a detective to come to the jail to see the prisoners
that he thought of them.</p>

<p>The detective accompanied him.</p>

<p>“I have been on this fellow’s track for a long time,” he
explained. “Spotted him in the theater last night, but was
not going to arrest him till the show was over. The
woman with him created the disturbance, and two policemen
took them both in. I don’t want her for anything,
but I shall take the man back to Chicago, to answer to the
charge of forgery. I shall hold him here for requisition
papers.”</p>

<p>The jail was reached, and first Frank took a look at
the woman. He felt that she would prove to be the mysterious
woman of the veil, and he was right. She looked
up at him, and laughed.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Mr. Merriwell,” she said. “Pres and I
have made things rather warm for you, you must confess.
I reckon we made a mistake last night. We’d both been
looking on the wine when it was red, or we’d not attempted
to stampede the audience.”</p>

<p>“Why, it is the woman who claimed to be Havener’s
wife!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Here is the man,” said the detective.</p>

<p>Frank turned to another cell.</p>

<p>He was face to face with Philip Scudder, his old-time
enemy, who had reached the end of his rope at last!</p>

<p>But, in the hour of victory, Frank gave little heed to
those who had made his path to this present success a
hard and stormy one.</p>

<p>He was successful!</p>

<p>As a playwright and as an actor he had won the palm
of victory, the future seemed to promise all the rewards
his energy and enterprise deserved.</p>

<p>He had started out from college with the determination
to win wealth and fame. He had left the scenes of his
early triumphs and first misfortunes, with the firm purpose
to return honored and enriched by his own labors.</p>

<p>Now he was on the eve of accomplishing that purpose.</p>

<p>And as he looked into the future, the lines of will power
and determination that had always marked his handsome
countenance grew firmer, as he murmured:</p>

<p>“I will myself be ‘True Blue!’ Come what may, let
my paths for the next few months be as untoward as they
ever have been, difficulties shall but act as a spur to me in
my purpose. For I shall be, soon, I hope, once more a son
of ‘Old Eli.’”</p>

<p>BUFFALO BILL</p>

<p>King of the Plains</p>

<p>William Cody, Colonel U.S.A., is little known
under his real name, but when you call him by
the title conferred upon him by the hard-headed,
harder-fisted Western pioneers, why, the whole
world knows him—BUFFALO BILL!</p>

<p>Stories of his adventures would be most difficult
to write for one who had not shared his
camp-fire days; but Colonel Prentiss Ingraham,
who wrote the stories in Buffalo Bill’s Border
Stories, was his boon companion, sharing all of
his marvelous adventures—even to being wounded
with him.</p>

<p>Therefore, while apparently they are fiction,
actually, these stories are based upon fact and
written by a clever pen.</p>

<p>If you like good Western adventure, look up
the Buffalo Bill Border Stories at your news
dealer’s. There are many different ones—you
are bound to find them interesting and surprisingly
good at the price.</p>

<p>The Heart of the World</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, when Nick Carter first
appeared upon the literary stage as a fiction
character, he was looked upon as a curiosity—more
to be smiled at than taken seriously.</p>

<p>Now, however, he is the favorite of countless
millions of readers in every walk of life. Stories
of his adventures have been translated into
nearly every foreign tongue; he appears on the
screen in a series of most fascinating pictures
produced by Broadwell Productions, Inc.</p>

<p>In short, Nick Carter’s great triumph lies in
the fact that he has captured the heart of the
world.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
